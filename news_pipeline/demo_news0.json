The worst ever, says Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\n\"We are going to see economic data for the second quarter that is worse than any data we have seen for the economy,\" Powell said. \"There are direct consequences of the disease and measures we are taking to protect ourselves from it.\"\n\nThe recovery will be long and painful, but the economy could begin to bounce back significantly in the third quarter as businesses reopen, he added. While we won't go back to pre-coronavirus levels for quite some time, the third quarter could provide some economic relief.\n\n\"We will enter the new phase — and we are just beginning to maybe do that — where we will begin formal measures that require social distancing will be rolled back, gradually, and at different paces in different parts of the country. And in time, during this period, the economy will begin to recover,\" Powell said.\n\nPowell also noted that unemployment shot higher for minorities in the United States —much faster than it has for white Americans.\n\nJust a few months ago, the US labor market was the best-ever for minorities, Powell noted. Now, minorities are among the first to lose their jobs as stay-at-home orders have shuttered restaurants, movie theaters, retailers and many other businesses.\n\n\"It is heartbreaking, frankly, to see that all threatened now,\" Powell said. \"All the more need for our urgent response and also that of Congress, which has been urgent and large, and to do what we can to avoid longer run damage to the economy.\"\n\nPowell noted that people \"who are least able to bear it have been the first to lose their jobs, and they have little cushion to protect themselves.\n\n\"That is a very big concern,\" Powell said."}

The world's national, regional and local politicians now face this question: How much new infection and death is acceptable while easing coronavirus lockdowns to head off Great Depression-style misery?\n\nThe choice is especially stark in the United States since because of government neglect, the kind of blanket testing needed to isolate new infections is not in place. Some states getting back to business don't even satisfy lax White House recommendations that new cases should decline for 14 consecutive days before opening is considered.\n\nFrom Israel to Italy, Hong Kong to Spain and France to star pupil New Zealand, governments are polishing plans to ease lockdowns. But reflecting the leaders' dilemma, Britain's reemerging Prime Minister Boris Johnson rebuffed Conservative Party colleagues calling for an end to the lockdown, using political capital won by his own tough battle with Covid-19. Chancellor Angela Merkel, cautious as ever, warned we are on the \" thinnest of ice \" — and on Tuesday the reproductive rate of the virus rose in Germany — raising fears of a second stay-at-home order.\n\nRead More"}

So far, more than 1 million Americans have been infected and at least 58,965 have died. A leading model predicts more than 72,000 people will die in the US by early August.The sobering numbers come as some states move to reopen despite warnings from federal health officials.   Being able to test for the virus, track cases and isolate every infected American will be key factors in ensuring that second wave isn't as deadly, Fauci says.The US continues to lag behind in testing, according to a new report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The nation has performed 16.4 tests per 1,000 people, according to the report. Spain and Italy, with the second and third highest number of cases after the US, have conducted 22.3 and 29.7 tests per 1,000 people respectively.Fauci says the federal government needs to provide strategic guidance and assistance to help states up their number of conducted tests. He hopes he can guarantee everyone who needs a test can get one by the end of May or early June. \"The truth is that we're going in the right direction,\" he said. \"But we need to continue to partner in a very active collaborative way with the states, we need to help them the same way they need to do the execution.\"Some hopeful news in the pandemic emerged from a study on whether remdesivir could be used to treat Covid-19.Gilead Sciences, the maker of the investigational drug, said Wednesday it is \"aware of positive data emerging from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' (NIAID) study of the investigational antiviral remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19.\"Fauci, speaking alongside President Donald Trump at the White House, expressed optimism about the remdesivir trial, saying it showed the mortality rate trended \"towards being better\" among patients who took the drug. The data showed remdesivir has a \"clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,\" Fauci said Wednesday. The  executive director of the World Health Organization's health emergencies program, Dr. Mike Ryan, said it's too early to comment on the trial results. Your coronavirus questions, answeredHow reopenings will affect virus numbers In Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp began lifting restrictions on small businesses such as salons and bowling alleys last week, experts say the death toll will likely see a sharp rise as a result. \"There are a couple of conditions that really need to be met before you can safely lift social distancing restrictions,\" CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Celine Gounder said Tuesday.Those factors include a 14-day decline of cases and deaths, a hospital capacity for expected patients and the ability to do contact tracing and testing, she said. \"Georgia doesn't meet any of the criteria,\" Gounder added. Youyang Gu, the researcher behind one of the models shared by the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, projects the number of daily deaths in the state will nearly double by early August. The model assumes social distancing will relax slightly as the state continues to reopen. The number of deaths per day in Georgia will jump from 32 fatalities on May 1 to a projected 63 people dying each day by August 4, the model forecasts.The researcher's findings fall in line with what's predicted by another model that's often been cited by the White House. Dr. Chris Murray, director of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, said they've upped their August death toll for the US by about 7,000 since last week.The change, Murray says, comes from both longer peaks experienced by states and signs that states are becoming more active again. Some businesses in South Carolina, Alaska and Oklahoma reopened last week. Restaurants in Tennessee opened with restrictions this week while retails outlets will open at 50% capacity Wednesday.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced all retail stores, restaurants, movie theaters, malls, museums, and libraries will be allowed to reopen Friday but must remain at 25% capacity.Airlines will provide masks Since officials have now recommended Americans wear face masks in public to prevent further spread, some airlines say they'll provide the masks for passengers.American Airlines and United Airlines both said they'll be providing masks for passengers beginning in May.\"We are not mandating that passengers wear a mask however we strongly encourage travelers follow CDC guidance to wear a face covering when social distancing is difficult,\" United Airlines spokesperson Nicole Carriere told CNN.  \"By providing the masks, we're making it that much easier for them to do so.\"Meanwhile, in three major New York City area airports, terminal access will be restricted to ticketed passengers, airport employees and others who need to enter the airport for business, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced Tuesday.The measure will be enforced at John F. Kennedy Airport, LaGuardia Airport and Newark Liberty Airport.\"Due to Covid-19 related shifts in flight and passenger activity, changes in the airports' operational footprints, security, cleaning and maintenance protocols, and social distancing directives, the Port Authority will temporarily limit terminal access at the region's three major airports,\" the Port Authority said in a statement.CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the description of Anthony Fauci's medical expertise.CNN's Ray Sanchez, Jen Christensen, Amanda Watts, Andy Rose, Rob Frehse and Pete Muntean contributed to this report.

Some patients were given the drug while others received a placebo (dummy) treatment.\n\nDr Anthony Fauci who runs the NIAID said: \"The data shows remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery.\"\n\nHe said the results prove \"a drug can block this virus\" and were \"opening the door to the fact that we now have the capability of treating\" patients.\n\nThe impact on deaths is not as clear cut. The mortality rate was 8% in people given remdesivir and 11.6% in those given a placebo, but this result was not statistically significant, meaning scientists cannot tell if the difference is real.\n\nIt is also not clear who is benefiting. Is it allowing people who would have recovered anyway to do so more quickly? Or is it preventing people from needing treatment in intensive care? Did the drug work better in younger or older people? Or those with or without other diseases? Do patients have to be treated early when the virus is thought to peak in the body?\n\nThese will be important questions when the full details are eventually published, as a drug could have the twin benefit of saving lives and helping to lift lockdown.\n\nIf a medicine can stop people needing intensive care then the risk of hospitals being overwhelmed is smaller, and there is less need for social distancing.\n\nProf Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford, is running the world's largest trial of Covid-19 drugs. He said: \"We need to see the full results, but if confirmed this would be a fantastic result and great news for the fight against Covid-19.\n\n\"The next steps are to get the full data out and work on equitable access to remdesivir.\"\n\nThe US data on remdesivir has come out at the same time as a trial of the same drug in China, reported in the Lancet medical journal, showed it was ineffective.\n\nHowever, that trial was incomplete because the success of lockdown in Wuhan meant doctors ran out of patients.\n\n\"These data are promising, and given that we have no proven treatments yet for Covid, it may well lead to fast-track approval of remdesivir for treatment of Covid,\" said Prof Babak Javid, a consultant in infectious diseases at Cambridge University Hospitals.\n\n\"However, it also shows that remdesivir is not a magic bullet in this context: the overall benefit in survival was 30%.\"\n\nOther drugs being investigated for Covid-19 include those for malaria and HIV which can attack the virus as well as compounds that can calm the immune system.\n\nIt is though the anti-virals may be more effective in the early stages, and the immune drugs later in the disease.\n\nFollow James on Twitter"}

The Federal Reserve has also taken with a slew of emergency steps, including lowering interest rates to near zero.\n\nOn Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the bank would maintain those levels until it was \"confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track\". But he warned that the ongoing crisis would \"weigh heavily\" on the economy.\n\n\"Will there be a need to do more? I would say the answer to that will be a yes,\" Mr Powell said at a virtual press conference.\n\n'Unprecedented' shock\n\nSince mid-March, more than 26 million people in the US have filed for unemployment, and the US has seen historic declines in business activity and consumer confidence. Forecasters expect growth to contract 30% or more in the three months to June.\n\n\"This is off the rails, unprecedented,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The economy has just been flattened.\"\n\nThe contraction in the US economy is part of a global slowdown as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn China, where restrictions were in place for much of the quarter, the economy shrank by 6.8% - its first quarterly contraction since record-keeping began in 1992.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Germany said its economy could shrink by a record 6.3% this year.\n\n\"We will experience the worst recession in the history of the federal republic\" founded in 1949, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said.\n\nBusiness hit\n\nBefore the coronavirus knocked the global economy off course, the US economy was expected to grow about 2% this year.\n\nBut by mid April, more than 95% of the country was was in some form of lockdown. Although some states have started to remove the orders, they remain in place in many others, including major economic engines such as New York and California.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: 'They risk their lives just to cut my hair'\n\nMany companies have warned of significant hits related to the pandemic as they share quarterly results with investors.\n\nOn Tuesday, General Electric said its revenues had fallen 8% in the first quarter, while Boeing - already in crisis after fatal crashes of its 737 Max plane - reported a 48% revenue fall, and said it planned to reduce output and cut jobs.\n\n\"The coronavirus pandemic is affecting every aspect of our business, including airline customer demand, production continuity and supply chain stability,\" chief executive Dave Calhoun said.\n\nDespite the widespread warnings, share prices have increased in recent weeks after steep declines earlier in the year. Those gains reflect the Fed's intervention, but not its forecast for the economy, said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.\n\n\"[Mr Powell] provided a very sobering assessment of the economic impact, acknowledging that this will not just be a short, sharp shock, but a more prolonged event,\" she said.\n\n\"With financial markets being backstopped by the Fed for the foreseeable future, they will likely continue to signal a narrative that is very detached from the Fed's own solemn economic assessment.\"\n\nConsumer hit\n\nThe Commerce Department on Wednesday said consumer spending - which accounts for about two thirds of the US economy - dropped 7.6% in the first three months of the year.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is grappling with the worst economic crisis since the 1930\n\nSpending on food services and accommodation plummeted more than 70%, while clothing and footwear purchases were down more than 40%.\n\nHealth spending also plunged - despite the virus - as concerns about infection prompted doctors to postpone routine treatments and other medical care.\n\nThe economic pain in the US is expected to be even more severe in the April-June period, but economists say even the estimate for the first quarter is likely to be revised lower, as the government receives more data.\n\n\"It's very difficult to gauge the depth of the decline,\" Mr Zandi said. \"We won't really know the extent of the economic damage for years.\""}

Last week, Mexico's Senate approved a measure to take similar steps.\n\nEl Salvador, however, has taken a hardline approach, insisting convicted gangsters are taking advantage of the pandemic.\n\nOn Wednesday, there was further controversy in Argentina, after Carlos Capdevila, a doctor convicted of crimes against humanity, was among those to be granted house arrest.\n\nA judge said the 70-year-old prisoner, who worked at the notorious Esma detention centre during the dictatorship, was at risk from Covid-19 because of \"high blood pressure, prostate cancer and motor difficulties\"."}

Aulas' Lyon side finished third in 2018-19, Marseille were out of European competition in fifth. Guess which team was in seventh and whose in second when play was halted this term?\n\nMonaco's Wissam Ben Yedder is joint top of the Ligue 1 goalscoring charts with Kylian Mbappe\n\nAulas' suggestion is not one of three possible scenarios set out by an LFP working group, though. They are:\n\nbase the final standings on a points-per-game average\n\nfinalise the table on the last full round of games played - 27 in the case of Ligue 1\n\ntake the standings as they were after 19 matches, the halfway point of the season\n\nThe solution is now likely to be decided by a general assembly vote of France's professional clubs.\n\nIn all three cases, the current top four would stay the same, happily fulfilling Uefa's hope that the 2020-21 European participants would be decided on \"sporting merit\" - Paris St-Germain as champions and Marseille would qualify for the Champions League group stage with Rennes heading into the third qualifying round.\n\nLille would finish fourth to take Ligue 1's only Europa League qualifying place.\n\nHowever, if the two Europa League places available from the domestic cup competitions are given to the teams finishing fifth and sixth in the league, expect squabbling: Lyon, Montpellier, Reims, Nantes and Nice would all have a claim.\n\nWhile the third promotion/relegation place - decided by a play-off in normal circumstances - is likely to not be attributed, L1 strugglers Toulouse and Amiens are set to be relegated, replaced by Ligue 2 top two Lorient and Lens.\n\nPSG's Champions League hopes dashed\n\nWinning a ninth league title in these circumstances will sting, especially as Thomas Tuchel's men were 12 points clear and would have matched arch-rival Marseille's nine French crowns at a canter.\n\nBut they also wanted to equal Marseille in another way, by becoming France's second Champions League winner.\n\nAfter getting over the formidable obstacle of Borussia Dortmund and clearing an even bigger psychological barrier to reach the quarter-finals for the first time in four attempts, PSG were looking good.\n\nNeymar - key against Dortmund - was playing well and, crucially, for the team, Kylian Mbappe and Angel di Maria were in sizzling form.\n\nFor the first time since Qatar Sports Investments took over the club in 2011 and stated they wanted to claim European football's premier prize, PSG looked in a promising position to do it.\n\n\"If it's not possible to play in France, we'll play our matches abroad,\" PSG chief executive and chairman Nasser Al Khelaifi said of the Champions League on Tuesday.\n\nBold and bullish in the boardroom then, but the reality on the pitch could be very different.\n\nIf Uefa manage to stage the remaining ties, Tuchel would have to mould his side into shape - mentally and physically - for potentially five top-grade matches with no competitive football in their legs between now and the end of August when the Champions League final might be staged.\n\nShould the other leagues restart, PSG would be at a massive disadvantage.\n\nMbappe, Neymar and the mercato\n\nNeymar and Kylian Mbappe finish the French campaign with 31 top-flight goals between them\n\nThe Spanish press have been getting excited over the possibility of seeing both of PSG's crown jewels in La Liga next season. Mbappe has made little secret of his love of Real Madrid and hero-worship of manager Zinedine Zidane, while Neymar had already pushed hard to move back to Barcelona last summer.\n\nWill they go this time? Unlikely.\n\nMbappe will be in a stronger bargaining position in 2021 with a year left on his contract and - according to recent reports in France - the Emir of Qatar's \"will\" is for the World Cup winner to stay.\n\nThe same goes for Neymar, another favourite of the Gulf state's ruler, and he too has another two years on his PSG deal.\n\nMost significantly, the tears that flooded from him after qualifying behind closed doors against Dortmund, and the acclaim of the fans outside the Parc des Princes' locked gates, suggested his Nou Camp nostalgia is no more.\n\nA thornier question for other less financially muscled French clubs will be how to hold on to their best players in the summer transfer window, if there is a mercato, as it's known in France.\n\nThe money\n\n\"This stoppage raises other problems, one of which is decisive, the economic one,\" said Marseille boss Andre Villas-Boas who, while hailing a \"logical\" decision by the government, added soberly: \"The survival of the clubs depends on it.\"\n\nIn France, arguably even more than anywhere else, the money is a pressing issue. The current TV rights deal is due to expire at the season's end with the new contract, largely financed by Mediapro, worth 60% more, tipping the Ligue 1 clubs' pot over the 1bn euros (£0.86bn) mark.\n\nClubs were desperate to finish the 20190-20 campaign though as they were reliant on the more than 200m euros due as the final slice of the cake broadcasters Canal+ and BeIN SPORTS had shared for the last four years. Most of that sum now looks highly unlikely to be paid.\n\nWith nearly 40% of Ligue 1 outfits' budgets coming from the TV deal, and Rennes currently the only top-flight side whose players have agreed to a wage cut, the future of some clubs is in the balance."}

Others say they feel pressured into agreeing to play by politicians and league bosses when they would prefer the season to be abandoned.\n\nPrivately, the mood within both the Premier League and in Whitehall suggests cautious optimism remains.\n\nAnd there are some reasons for positivity too. Political leaders in Switzerland, for instance, have announced that the country's Super League will \"probably\" resume on 8 June if there's no worsening of the outbreak. Uefa's medical chief Professor Tim Meyer, meanwhile, has said it is \"definitely possible\" to plan for the suspended 2019-20 season to restart. Read into that what you will.\n\nBut by the time Friday's Premier League meeting takes place, is there a real danger that Project Restart could have suffered a false start?\n\nThe clubs know that, ultimately, they will take their lead from government, and their medical and scientific experts. That was proved by what happened across the Channel, where the French league's modelling and scenario planning was suddenly rendered meaningless when Prime Minister Edouard Philippe made his shock announcement, and the season was abruptly cancelled, as it has been in the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nGovernment approval in the UK relies on key criteria such as improved testing capacity, and a relaxation of social distancing rules being met.\n\nBut ministers and their advisers will also be hanging on Angela Merkel's every word on Thursday when the German chancellor addresses regional leaders, and no doubt discusses the Bundesliga's plans to resume matches in mid-May - plans that have acted as a source of inspiration to other countries around Europe.\n\nBut with a recent spike in cases in Germany raising fears that their lockdown may be tightened again, if Merkel follows the French in ruling sport out for several months, some believe the game could be up for the Premier League too.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device 'Avoid playing competitive football' - Fifa's medical committee chair\n\nHow realistic would it be, after all, that Germany, which has suffered far fewer cases and deaths from coronavirus than the UK, and has conducted many more tests, could deem sport too dangerous, but that conclusion not be reached here?\n\nLet us not forget that Wednesday's government briefing brought the news of another 765 deaths in the UK.\n\nAnd with so much scrutiny of whether the British government was too slow to shut sport down last month, and whether events like the Cheltenham Festival and Liverpool's Champions League fixture against Atletico Madrid at Anfield are linked to the numbers of local cases, the UK would surely not want to be an outlier.\n\nThis time last week, amid growing anxiety over the apparent financial crisis that abandoning the season would trigger, the Premier League's hopes of a return to action were beginning to fade.\n\nBut then, with frustration growing among some executives at what they saw as a lack of guidance from government, suddenly came encouragement.\n\nWith Prime Minister Boris Johnson preparing to return to work after recuperating from his own brush with coronavirus, the league was told Downing Street wanted top-flight football back as soon as possible, to help boost people's morale after months in lockdown, and to support the game commercially, with many jobs on the line and the wider football industry desperate for a restart.\n\nPremier League bosses had let it be known just how important it was that the season be completed, pointing to the three-quarters of a billion pounds that contractually would have to be paid back to live TV rights-holders Sky and BT.\n\nWhether the two broadcasters actually intend to demand all of the refund they are entitled to if the season cannot resume remains unclear. I understand they are considering asking to show more matches next year, or requesting a year's free extension to their current deal to mitigate the damage their businesses have suffered. But some kind of compensation will almost certainly have to be paid.\n\nLast weekend BBC Sport revealed that football's senior medical experts, along with their counterparts in rugby, racing and cricket, were to be invited to a series of virtual meetings, in what was described to me as a \"quickening of the pace\" in preparations for a resumption.\n\nMinisters continued to make supportive statements to the media and in parliament. A number of clubs reopened their training grounds for restricted use by their players. Premier League club doctors held a meeting of their own to discuss hygiene standards and proposed twice-weekly testing of players. Clubs were asked to consider the concept of playing in sealed, neutral venues. Broadcasters have been told to work out the minimum numbers of staff they would need at matches.\n\nBut major questions still need to be answered if professional sport is to get back on the pitch any time soon, while avoiding damaging headlines.\n\nHow do football and other major sports avoid being a drain on an under-strain NHS if athletes are injured and need an ambulance or hospital treatment?\n\nHow acceptable is it that highly paid stars have access to tests while members of the public are struggling to get them, even if the sporting tests are being funded privately?\n\nAnd what if fans gather outside stadiums or elsewhere to celebrate, with the pressure on policing that would inevitably involve?\n\nIs it right that more effort is made by the government to help a few of the professional sports get back up and running before less wealthy, publicly funded Olympic and Paralympic sports, along with grassroots sport?\n\nAfter the controversial furloughing of staff by some clubs, an unseemly row with players over proposed wage cuts, and some regrettable failures to uphold social distancing rules by some teams, football can ill-afford more blows to its reputation.\n\nExactly seven weeks ago the Premier League found itself in a similar position to the precarious one it faces now. With sports event across the world shutting down or going behind closed doors, it defiantly pressed on, issuing a statement insisting that the following weekend's fixtures would go ahead as planned.\n\nAccused of poor judgement, less than an hour later it was forced into announcing an emergency meeting when Arsenal revealed coach Mikel Arteta had contracted coronavirus. No football matches have been played since.\n\nOn that occasion, with the government still insisting it was safe for such events to continue, the Premier League and other sports authorities were left to reach their own conclusions.\n\nBut several weeks on, much has changed, and the stakes have become even higher. And this time, one suspects the decision will be taken out of football's hands."}

The first leg at Old Trafford saw future Chelsea boss Antonio Conte strike the Italian giants into an early, away-goal lead, before a second-half siege from Sir Alex Ferguson's men finally bore fruit when Ryan Giggs hammered into the roof of the net in the last minute.\n\nJuve were favourites in the second leg, even more so when Pippo Inzaghi scored twice in the first 11 minutes. Game over? Nobody told Roy Keane. His header gave United hope, and, even after a booking for a hack on Zinedine Zidane ruled him out of any potential final, the Irishman drove on.\n\nDwight Yorke headed United level on the night - ahead on away goals - before half-time in this classic encounter. Inzaghi had a hat-trick 'goal' correctly ruled out for offside, before Andy Cole tapped in confirmation.\n\nMan Utd 3-3 Bayer Leverkusen (2002)\n\nStar players: Van Nistelrooy, Giggs, Veron, Keane, Ballack, Lucio, Berbatov, Neuville, Basturk\n\nManchester United and Bayer Leverkusen had never met in the Champions League before the 2002 semi-final\n\nThe thankfully short-lived era of two group stages meant that United had already played 14 games in the Champions League before coming up against Bayer Leverkusen in 2002.\n\nThe German side were not one of the traditional superpowers, but they had assembled a formidable outfit - with Michael Ballack the beating heart.\n\nUnited were at home first again, and took the lead when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's shot was deflected in by Boris Zivkovic. After the break Ballack equalised, only for Ruud van Nistelrooy to win, and convert a penalty.\n\nBut Leverkusen weren't done and grabbed a vital second away goal through substitute Oliver Neuville, who buried a ricochet in the area just three minutes after coming on. That gave the visitors the advantage going into game two, but most still fancied United to reach the final again.\n\nBig game, big name - Roy Keane danced around goalkeeper Hans-Jorg Butt to put United ahead in a pulsating second leg. Advantage Sir Alex, and a place in the final in his home city of Glasgow was close.\n\nThat man Neuville had the last word though, turning on the edge of the box to fire over Fabien Barthez and score via the underside of the crossbar. Leverkusen advanced to Hampden where they got Zidaned...\n\nReal Madrid 3-4 Juventus (2003)\n\nStar players: Carlos, Figo, Zidane, Ronaldo, Buffon, Thuram, Nedved, Del Piero, Trezeguet\n\nAlessandro del Piero starred as Juventus squeezed past Real Madrid in 2003\n\nThis was peak Galacticos era - just look at some of the names involved…\n\nThe first leg was in Madrid and El Fenomeno was at it again, Ronaldo opening the scoring with a superb finish from the edge of the area after a masterful one-two with Fernando Morientes. That was a spanner in Juve's gameplan of containment, but they grabbed an away goal on the stroke of half time when David Trezeguet found himself free to stab in an Alessandro Del Piero shot. Silence in the Bernabeu.\n\nReal were back in front when a Roberto Carlos piledriver snaked its way through a crowded area to find the back of the net and it was on to Turin.\n\nRonaldo was only on the bench for leg two because of injury so Raul stepped in as Juve looked to overturn the deficit.\n\nCarlos and Pavel Nedved both went close early on before Trezeguet extended one of those long limbs again to hook in Del Piero's header and put Juve ahead on away goals.\n\nDel Piero - brilliant all night - then twisted the great Fernando Hierro inside out before firing home from 16 yards. Real needed a goal, on went Ronaldo, and he won a penalty with a trademark bodyswerve.\n\nUp stepped Luis Figo, to attempt to level the tie, but Gigi Buffon guessed right to save his effort. It was the key moment as within five minutes Nedved had outpaced Hierro to fire in, and while Zinedine Zidane scored on his old manor, it was too late.\n\nLiverpool 1-0 Chelsea (2005)\n\nStar players: Carragher, Gerrard, Alonso, Garcia, Terry, Lampard, Drogba, Cech.\n\nLuis Garcia scored the decisive goal as Liverpool beat Chelsea in 2005\n\nLiverpool and Chelsea played out a trilogy of semi-finals between 2005 and 2008, and then squeezed in a bonkers 7-5 quarter-final as well.\n\nThe original tie, in Jose Mourinho's first season in England, was by no means a classic in terms of swashbuckling football, but for pure lingering drama it warrants a place on the list.\n\nAfter a largely forgettable first leg, a stale goalless draw at Stamford Bridge, Anfield was absolutely rocking by kick-off. Chelsea were romping towards the Premier League title but Liverpool had the weight of European history behind them, and it seemed to work too.\n\nRemember the 'ghost goal?'\n\nSteven Gerrard's flick around the corner caught Chelsea's defence flat-footed, Milan Baros nicked it past Petr Cech and went down. Could it have been a penalty?\n\nLuis Garcia didn't hang around to find out, poking the loose ball across goal. It struck John Terry, squirmed forwards and William Gallas hooked it clear. Was it over the line?\n\nEven 15 years on there isn't a conclusive angle to be found. Today we would know for sure thanks to goalline technology but referee Lubos Michel awarded it and that's all that mattered.\n\nChelsea piled forwards late on but could not find a breakthrough as Gerrard and co rocked on to Istanbul and more improbable drama...\n\nAC Milan 5-3 Man Utd (2007)\n\nStar players: Kaka, Seedorf, Maldini, Ronaldo, Rooney\n\nKaka proved the difference as AC Milan saw off Man Utd in 2007 to reach the Champions League final\n\nAs Liverpool and Chelsea locked horns again, Manchester United were back in the last four and things were looking good for the hosts when Cristiano Ronaldo scored in the first five minutes at Old Trafford, a scruffy header from a corner.\n\nBut then Kaka entered the scene. The best player in the world in 2007, the Brazilian collected a pass and glided past Gabriel Heinze with ease before planting a fine low shot into the far corner. It was a beautiful goal, but nothing on what was to follow as Milan's playmaker made fools of the United defence. He chased a ball down the left wing, headed past Darren Fletcher and then flicked the ball over Heinze's head.\n\nAs the Argentine defender and Patrice Evra both came to clear the ball, Kaka headed it past them leaving the two men in red to collide like drunks. A sure finish in front of a bemused Stretford End and Milan were on top.\n\nThe game was far from over though - Wayne Rooney collected a peach of a ball from Paul Scholes to level on the night, before powering in from range in stoppage time to give United a slender lead.\n\nOver in a sodden San Siro, it was Kaka once again who proved the difference maker, a delicious left-footed drive putting Milan back ahead on away goals early on. And when Clarence Seedorf also beat Edwin van der Sar from the edge of the area, an Istanbul rematch with Liverpool was well and truly on the cards. Alberto Gilardino provided the coup de grace. Kaka would move on to Real for a hefty fee but would sadly never really find that level of form again. He was unplayable.\n\nBarcelona 1-1 Chelsea (2009)\n\nStar players: Messi, Xavi, Iniesta, Terry, Lampard, Drogba\n\nChelsea were left fuming with referee Tom Ovrebo as they were knocked out of the Champions League by Barcelona in 2009\n\nFor a club with only one Champions League trophy to their name, Chelsea haven't half provided some drama in the last 20 years. None more so than in this feisty tie in 2009, which will be remembered for the performance of referee Tom Ovrebo.\n\nAfter a goalless draw at the Nou Camp, Chelsea were on course for a second straight final when Michael Essien scored one of the great forgotten goals, a 25-yard volley which smashed in off the underside of the crossbar. A beauty eclipsed by the beast of a display from Ovrebo.\n\nChelsea felt they should have had four penalties, and even their staunchest critics would have to concede that they should have had at least one, most obviously for a handball from Gerard Pique.\n\nOvrebo said no - although he did send off Eric Abidal - and deep into added time Andres Iniesta swept in superbly from Lionel Messi's pass.\n\nChelsea couldn't believe it - remember Didier Drogba's 'disgrace' rant straight down the camera?\n\nChelsea 3-2 Barcelona (2012)\n\nStar players: Lampard, Drogba, Ramires, Terry, Messi, Sanchez, Fabregas, Iniesta\n\nJohn Terry saw red as Chelsea held on to beat Barcelona in 2012\n\nRevenge was served up by Chelsea in the Nou Camp.\n\nThe opening game at the Bridge saw Alexis Sanchez lob against the crossbar and Cesc Fabregas have one scrambled off the line before that man Didier Drogba steered Chelsea ahead.\n\nPedro hit the post but Chelsea held on to take a slender lead to Spain where, truly against the odds, Pep, Messi et al were beaten by Roberto Di Matteo's team.\n\nOne of the finest second legs ever? Before last season, sure.\n\nMessi was at his absolute best, leading Chelsea's defence a merry dance with some blinding one-twos and mesmeric dribbling and, while Petr Cech denied the talisman, it was anchorman Sergio Busquets who popped up with a tap-in to level the aggregate scores.\n\nIt was one-way traffic though and soon Chelsea were seriously up against it when captain John Terry saw red for a knee in the back of Sanchez. Centre-half partner Gary Cahill had already gone off injured. Makeshift stuff.\n\nMessi then teed up Andres Iniesta to make it 2-1 on aggregate and Chelsea needed a goal. Ramires was the unlikely man to find it, a superb finish to lob Victor Valdes - all of this before half time.\n\nThat meant that Chelsea were up on away goals - but could they hang on with Branislav Ivanovic and Jose Bosingwa at centre-back?!\n\nThey could. Somehow. Barca completed over 700 passes and had 22 shots on goal. They had a penalty when Drogba tripped Cesc Fabregas, but Messi planted it against the crossbar. The little genius also hit the post, a third Barca goal seemed inevitable but never came - and then with everyone pushed forwards they were caught on the break as Fernando Torres had the whole half to run into. He rounded Valdes and rolled in to cap a remarkable win.\n\nBorussia Dortmund 4-3 Real Madrid (2013)\n\nStar players: Lewandowski, Reus, Gotze, Hummels, Ronaldo, Ozil, Alonso, Ramos\n\nRobert Lewandowski scored a first-leg treble as Borussia Dortmund knocked out Real Madrid in 2013\n\nIt was the first year Jurgen Klopp had come to the attention of many in the UK, with Dortmund scoring twice in added time to beat Malaga in the previous round. Still, they weren't fancied to pull up too many trees against Real, but produced a remarkable first-leg display at the Westfalenstadion.\n\nRobert Lewandowski - who would leave a year later for free - scored four times as Ronaldo's Real were routed 4-1. The Polish forward was too mobile for Pepe and Sergio Ramos, scoring a second-half hat-trick in front of the yellow wall.\n\nReal needed a 3-0 win in the second leg to go through - which was not beyond the realms - but a fine performance from Klopp's men looked to have done enough. But two goals in the last 10 minutes, from Karim Benzema and Sergio Ramos, ensured a nervy finale.\n\nTottenham 3-3 Ajax (2019)\n\nStar players: Moura, Son, Eriksen, Van de Beek, Tadic, Ziyech, De Ligt\n\nLast season may well have produced the two greatest semi-final second legs in Champions League history.\n\nAjax had been the breakout side of 2018-19, beating Real Madrid and Juventus to set up a tie with Spurs. So it was perhaps no surprise when they left London with a 1-0 lead.\n\nIn Amsterdam things went from bad to worse for Tottenham. With no Harry Kane up front, they were facing a mountain in the lowlands when Matthijs de Ligt and Hakim Ziyech made it 3-0 on aggregate before half-time.\n\nSpurs needed a miracle and Lucas Moura duly provided one. The forward scored twice in the space of four minutes to leave the visitors needing one goal to go through, and after Jan Vertonghen had headed against the post, Moura drove in low to complete his hat-trick and book an all-English final against Liverpool.\n\nChristian Eriksen called for a statue for his goalscoring teammate. As of time of writing that remains outstanding...\n\nBarcelona 3-4 Liverpool (2019)\n\nStar players: Messi, Suarez, Coutinho, Pique, Origi, Mane, Henderson, Alexander-Arnold\n\nLiverpool, having their best Premier League season in years, went to Barcelona on a high. Finalists the previous year, Jurgen Klopp's side had hit a groove and played well in the Nou Camp, Sadio Mane and Mo Salah going close, but still lost 3-0.\n\nLuis Suarez stabbed in the opener, Lionel Messi scored twice including a dream free-kick, and Liverpool were all but out.\n\nLiverpool needed a second-leg miracle. Salah and Roberto Firmino were missing just to add to their woes, but Liverpool found a new and unlikely hero in the shape of Divock Origi.\n\nThe big man pulled one back in the first 10 minutes, and as belief rose inside a fervent Anfield, midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum popped up with two goals in two minutes to level the tie.\n\nRarely have you seen Barcelona so ruffled. Messi was as anonymous as he was omnipresent just a week earlier, and when Origi swept in Trent Alexander-Arnold's quick corner with 11 minutes left the incredible had become credible."}

With an in-stadia environment, with international players, it's going to be very, very difficult.\"\n\nMore than 180,000 tickets have already been bought for matches, some of which were due to be televised live on the BBC.\n\n\"The mood and wave cricket was on in England last year made it an amazing opportunity this year to play The Hundred, but obviously with what has happened around the world, that is going to be harder now,\" added Moeen, who is due to captain Birmingham Phoenix.\n\n\"If we can get other international players who were not available this year, it can make The Hundred even stronger for next year and we can attract a new audience to come and watch cricket.\"\n\nThe 18 first-class counties were each set to receive £1.3m from The Hundred, money which the ECB confirmed in March had already begun to be distributed.\n\nAnd while Harrison admitted the game in England and Wales is facing a \"very significant financial problem\", he reiterated the ECB's commitment to The Hundred and the costs that will come with launching it at a later date.\n\n\"The reason why the Hundred was put in place was as a way of growing the game in this country and Covid-19 simply exacerbates the requirement for us to grow the game in this country,\" he said last week.\n\n\"The Hundred is going to generate revenue, interest and excitement and that is the kind of thing we need to continue to prioritise as we go through this enormous challenge\n\n\"I see the case for The Hundred being much greater than it was, if that is indeed even in question.\"\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, England fast bowler Stuart Broad said The Hundred will be \"vital to the health of English cricket over the next few years\", adding it is imperative the T20 Blast - involving the 18 first-class counties - is prioritised this summer.\n\n\"I don't think the sport will take any risks, I think we'll only get playing live cricket when it's been safe to do by the government,\" Broad added."}

Here's everything we know so far about what’s in store.\n\nWho will show up?\n\nAs originally announced, the special will feature the entire main cast: Poehler, Rashida Jones, Aziz Ansari, Nick Offerman, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Pratt, Adam Scott, Rob Lowe, Jim O’Heir, and Retta. And Schur revealed that the special will have about a half-dozen guest stars mixed in. \"The first face you see on camera will not be one of the 10 main cast members,\" he said, \"and that sort of sets the tone for the show in general.\"\n\nWhere are they now?\n\nThe final season of Parks and Rec filmed in 2014, was set in the year 2017, and flashed forward all the way to 2065, which created challenges for an episode set in our present day. \"Ordinarily you can just make everything up and start from scratch, but we had already said what had happened to everyone in years past, and so we had to go back and retrofit everything and make sure it made sense,\" Schur said. While he assured that the episode is canon, he said it wouldn't involve any winks to the future the finale laid out for the characters.\n\nPer the show's conclusion, the year 2020 would find Leslie, Ben Wyatt (Scott), April Ludgate (Plaza), and Andy Dwyer (Pratt) in Washington, D.C., with Leslie working at the National Parks Service within the Department of the Interior and Ben serving as a congressman. Chris Traeger (Lowe) and Ann Perkins (Jones) are together in Michigan, with Chris working at the University of Michigan and Ann having returned to nursing. Donna (Retta) is in Seattle treating herself, and the only main character left in Pawnee is Mayor Jerry Garry Gergich (O'Heir).\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nIs everyone safe?\n\nSchur made one thing crystal-clear about the characters of the Parks and Rec reunion special: \"Nobody has had or is currently suffering from COVID-19.\" He added that \"the whole special is not about the disease, honestly. It's about people coping with it and sort of trying to navigate in their daily lives.\" While Ann is a working nurse, the special gives her a moment to explain how she does mostly outpatient work, meaning she's not on the front line of treating coronavirus cases.\n\nHow did the episode come together?\n\nRunning through the conception of the special, Schur said it started on a call with Universal Television President Pearlena Igbokwe about charity ideas. Afterward Schur reached out to see if the cast members would be available for something, and they all responded within 45 minutes. After taking a walk with his wife, Single Parents co-creator J.J. Philbin, Schur realized that if he was going to reunite everyone, it should be for something new rather than a rehash of an old episode.\n\nWith a special reunion episode in mind, Schur got fellow executive producer Morgan Sackett to direct and called in six of the show's former writers (including Joe Mande and Megan Amram) to work on it with him. They wrote the script in two and a half days, the scripts were shipped out to the cast along with iPhones and special camera rigs for everyone to record themselves, and the episode was shot over four days, with workarounds explaining why the show's married characters happen to not be in the same room.\n\nFor postproduction, Schur brought in the visual effects team from his other show The Good Place to work with editors \"to make it look like not everyone was just sitting alone in their houses staring at their computers.\" All in all, from his chat with Igbokwe to the episode airing Thursday, the reunion special was a quick but arduous three-week process.\n\nWill the special lead to a reboot?\n\n\"I would never say never, because why bother to say never,\" Schur replied to the question of a Parks and Rec reboot. He went on to say he never had any previous plans to bring the show back until the pandemic came along and he wanted to rally even more behind Feeding America. He felt the show already got to say everything it needed to during its initial run. \"We made our point, so I don't anticipate any long-term reboot or anything like that,\" he said.\n\nWhen will the reunion air?\n\nThe new episode of Parks and Rec will air Thursday, April 30, at 8:30 p.m. ET on NBC, following a televised version of the cast's reunion at the Paley Center last year.\n\nRelated content:"}

Today, it’s become an iconic anthem for theatre kids and anyone outside the mainstream.\n\nIn honor of the Rent’s 24th anniversary, we called up much of the original cast and production team to find out just how this ode to being an us for once entered the annals of musical theater history.\n\nFollowing the framework of original opera, La Bohème, Rent closes its second act with “La Vie Bohème.” As a production team and cast were assembled, the song made quite the impact with its dizzying list of cultural references, raw language, and tongue-twisting lyrics.\n\nMICHAEL GREIF (Director): The first time I heard songs from the show was on an airplane, and I was very churned up by a lot of the material.\n\nBILLY ARONSON (Co-creator and playwright): [In La Bohème, Rudolfo] goes outside in the second act to meet all his friends on Christmas Eve. So that scene was in the play. I gave [Jonathan Larson] an outline in which they were all at the table, all together, all meeting each other but that was his idea to have that song there.\n\nTIM WEIL (Musical supervisor): Jonathan printed out the original score in a musical notation software, and I remember seriously looking at those lyrics just trying to make them out so I could understand them. Once I figured out what all those words were, I just went, “This is one of the most amazing list songs I have ever seen in my life.”\n\nARONSON: From the beginning of our collaboration, Jonathan thought Rent would be \"our generation's Hair.” And it seems to me that the song \"La Vie Bohème\" is inspired in part by Hair, almost paying tribute to it. In particular, Claude's song “Manchester England, England,” where he starts dropping all those names.\n\nANTHONY RAPP (Mark Cohen): In the fall of '94, when I did what we call the studio production, the first day of rehearsal I went home and I had cassette tapes of demos that Jonathan Larson had made. “La Vie Bohème” was one of those. I was completely knocked out immediately.\n\nMARLIES YEARBY (Choreographer): Celebration was the first thing I heard when I first heard “La Vie Bohème.” I heard a real celebration of life, individuality, who you are.\n\nRAPP: Hearing for the first time “To faggots, lezzies, dykes, crossdressers too; To people living with, living with, living with, not dying from disease,” it was really like a bolt of energy coming out of my little boombox hitting me. It was really exciting that I was going to get to be a part of a show that was putting that out into the world at a time when people weren't declaring such things so boldly and joyfully. I just love the re-embracing of those words that are used as epithets.\n\nDAPHNE RUBIN-VEGA (Mimi Marquez): Those were things that we didn't say, particularly, and then all of a sudden, blink, and [we] say it on Broadway.\n\nADAM PASCAL (Roger Davis): My first thought was, “How are we going to memorize all these lyrics?” And then my second thought was, “I don't know what half these things mean.”\n\nGREIF: One of the first things I did when I got to really look at the lyrics was a little research on all of the people who were named as inspirations in the song.\n\nWILSON JERMAINE HEREDIA (Angel Dumott Schunard): I was a club kid during that time, so I was familiar with a lot of the references in the song, but I thought here's a song that 100 percent addresses me and I feel included.\n\nRUBIN-VEGA: I actually knew a lot of the references. It was talking to a multicultural part of me. [The clubs and such mentioned] were actual places in history that I had experiential knowledge of. That's why I got hired. I didn't get hired because I was the best. I got hired because I knew exactly what it was that they were talking about.\n\nRAPP: I was familiar with almost of all them. I remember 8BC was one I needed to discover for myself. There was a whole packet that was put together by our dramaturg and Michael Greif and Jonathan.\n\nWEIL: We actually did a big glossary, like a handout, of who all these people were, what all these things are, [why they] matter, and the only person or thing I didn't know was the word \"entropy.\"\n\nFREDI WALKER-BROWNE (Joanne Jefferson): Jonathan gave us the references. He wrote it all out. He was amazing. He had a whole backstory Bible for us. I still have that somewhere. It was the backstories of all the characters, all the references in “La Vie Bohème.”\n\nRAPP: I do remember, during the rehearsal process, as I was tooling around New York, being on subway platforms and just going over the lyrics as I was waiting for the train.\n\nOriginally, “La Vie Bohème” was even longer than it is now, and the second act ended on “I Should Tell You.\"\n\nGREIF: “I Should Tell You” was the Act One finale, when I first looked at the script.\n\nWEIL: The evolution was basically they did “La Vie Bohème” and then they did “I Should Tell You,” and then there was a little Mark narration, a little kind of epilogue.\n\nGREIF: [We] recognized that we needed to fit “I Should Tell You” within “La Vie Bohème” so the act really ends with that kind of joyousness.\n\nWEIL: Jonathan went, “Let's put the first three-quarters of ‘La Vie Bohème’ first and fold in ‘I Should Tell You.’” “I Should Tell You” was actually substantially longer; there was an extra verse, the chorus was twice as long. Part of my job was to make it feel like something that's an interlude in a much larger package, but still a song by itself. Now it's a single piece, as opposed to a really great song and then a love ballad and then an epilogue.\n\nGREIF: There were many, many more verses that I can't even recall.\n\nWEIL: There’s a lost second extra verse that I am in possession of. When we were in China, because of censorship, we had to take out some of the “La Vie Bohème” lyrics, and I actually replaced them with some of the lyrics from the verse that was cut. They weren’t as graphic or explicit.\n\nGREIF: [Cutting it down] was a wonderful combination of which one of those inspirations meant the most to Jonathan and getting Jonathan to understand in a lot of ways that less could be more.\n\nWEIL: There was a reference to Nirvana.\n\nRAPP: I remember Cannabis Citiva was one of the things on the list, Baudrillard, Derrida, Bertolt Brecht. It was just another list of things.\n\nThe cast gathers around a long line of metal tables, and led by Mark, they begin to pay tribute to “La Vie Bohème” in a deliberate attempt to offend Benny and the investors eating there. As Mark starts to sing and dance, the others follow.\n\nGREIF: The concept was very much the Last Supper. Because it's a mock wake for the death of La Vie Bohème, it seemed like that could be appropriate. Our wonderful choreographer Marlies Yearby found a real joy in just the presentational nature of that first image.\n\nRUBIN-VEGA: That's so Michael's brand, constructing from this metal or industrial kind of place. It wasn't about the furniture; it was about us and that was very freeing.\n\nWALKER-BROWNE: It’s as much exposition as it is anything else. You have so much going on in the story that is revealed through that song.\n\nGREIF: A lot of the initial staging was all about making points for Benny's benefit. There was a little danger and a little grit involved until he's defeated, and then, there's just a celebration of his defeat.\n\nYEARBY: The gesture dance at the top of the song I’ve named “The Dis Dance.\" It's inspired by the work of graffiti artist Jean Basquiat and the Dada Movement. It's something they all do. Everybody knows it sort of like the hustle. The first thing is to communicate that we're going to do the dis dance to Benny.\n\nWALKER-BROWNE: It feels organic and spontaneous, but it is so structured and it was so deliberate.\n\nYEARBY: If you look at the shoulder moves at the top, you would see that [Idina Menzel, who played Maureen Johnson] never does it correctly … But that’s brilliant to me. I never tried to make her 100 percent correct because she had an organic way of just being herself in it. It felt so completely real. I didn't want perfection.\n\nGREIF: It was really Anthony's best opportunity to have a good time when he spends so much of the musical worrying and fretting and taking care of everyone. It was his opportunity to really let go and show off a little. A lot of that staging came out of his really wonderful and vivid imagination.\n\nRAPP: I remember getting up on the table, and then I was just doing my weird spastic thing. I turned to Marlies and I was like, “Can you help me out here?” And she's like, “No, you do you.” That was empowering. If you want me to be a spaz, I'll be a spaz.\n\nYEARBY: I did not want the perfect dancing body. Anthony’s quirkiness and his relationship to rhythm was very off beat naturally. Because of how he lives in his body, there’s this little jerky, edged, twitchy thing he does when he’s singing. I capitalized on that and pulled the choreography to that place. I encouraged his natural offbeat way of moving and to this day love how his way of moving informed the character of Mark.\n\nPASCAL: The stuff we're all doing in sync before we get up on the table, with the shoulders and the pointing, all that stuff was all choreographed by Marlies. But once we were all up on the tables, that was all sort of freestyle.\n\nYEARBY: Dancing on the table is a given. It's a rebellion. Dancing on the table in a café definitely pushes the boundaries of the very conservative. You are not being conservative if you're jumping up on the table and dancing.\n\nRAPP: As it evolved, she started to sculpt and shape the peaks and valleys, like when people were high or low, but so much of it was meant to be our physical expressions of how we move to music.\n\nHEREDIA: She didn't impose a movement on you. She would say, \"How does this make you feel? Tell me what this sound makes you do.” Okay, we have to get from here, from stage right to stage center, how's it going to get through there?\n\nImage zoom JOAN MARCUS\n\nAs the number builds, it devolves into even more pointedly lewd gestures. The group climbs onto the table, often breaking into pairs doing distinctive choreographic interludes.\n\nGREIF: A lot of that staging came from the imaginations of that spectacular original company.\n\nYEARBY: Improvisation is at the base of my work. I will give them samples of what I'm talking about, or I'll give them a series of images that I want them to improvise inside.\n\nPASCAL: I'm not a dancer like the rest of the people in the cast and so left to my own devices, I just wanted to look as non-silly as possible and stay out of everybody's way. I also thought that approach worked for the character too. It didn't make sense to me that this character would have been some kickass dancer.\n\nHEREDIA: Part of it was interpreting the song almost literally. It felt like “a trisket, a trasket” schoolyard, hand-clapping game. Both Daphne and I got on the table. We played a mirror game initially with each other, when we first started playing with it. It just turned into that [hand-clapping] sequence.\n\nRUBIN-VEGA: Michael asked me to tone down the lewd gestures. I'm like, \"That's just how I feel inside.\" I was doing one of those sort of \"fongool\" arms with the fist, like the strong arm with the other arm between the crook of your arm kind of thing.\n\nRAPP: Some of the lewd gestures got more elaborate in future iterations. In our original thing, it wasn't a lot of that. It was more restrained in that it was more about the exuberance and the joyful nature of it.\n\nHEREDIA: Jesse L. Martin [who played Tom Collins] just has a kind of swag about him, The skipping with Jesse was more like a “Skip to My Lou” kind of thing, and then it just turned into a do-si-do with each other.\n\nYEARBY: I loved Jesse's feet. He loved to slip and slide around on his feet. He reminded me of James Brown, Michael Jackson, and Jackie Wilson. Those moments where he jumps out in front of the table, and we're celebrating; he's moving his feet heel-toe, heel-toe. His feet were unique, and I pulled that out every time.\n\nHEREDIA: The one thing you saw in that number is that we trusted each other. If I were all the way stage right on the table, I knew and felt what was going on all the way stage left at the end of the other table.\n\nPASCAL: You can't half-ass it through that number, if for no other reason than if you're not completely focused and on your game, someone's going to get hurt. There were lots of times where we would grab each other from falling off the table or stop one another from getting their fingers caught in between the tables because they would start to separate during the number.\n\nRAPP: When we were in the thick of our eight-show-a-week grind, that number was the hardest physically. If we were at all tired, it was a bear. It never stopped us from giving 100 percent, but it was like a mountain to climb.\n\nPASCAL: We all knew that this was the end of the act. Let's just blow this out, and then we get a nice 20-minute break.\n\nEach of the cast then gets a moment to strut their stuff individually, with Roger playing a lick on the guitar and Angel doing the catwalk.\n\nPASCAL: It was scripted with \"Musetta’s Waltz,\" and I would say nine times out of 10, I messed up that riff and didn’t play it right.\n\nHEREDIA: I was in a [ballroom] house myself; they called it the House of La Max. I was drawing from Max, who was an incredible vogue-er. Then, Michael Greif recommended Paris Is Burning to me. I had to take that whole film, literally all the energy from all the ball footage, and put it in that one little itty-bitty moment. It’s the one time I allowed Angel to actually enjoy being in the spotlight.\n\nAmidst this, the cast assembles into a now-iconic tableau, raise their fists, and bellow “Actual Reality - Act Up - Fight AIDS.”\n\nGREIF: When I first started on the show, I had spent a decade in New York, in the center of a terrible crisis. Jonathan and I were really familiar with Act Up and with a lot of other AIDS organization's protests. It was very easy to move that into the language of the musical.\n\nYEARBY: Michael threw out the \"Act Up, Fight AIDS\" gesture, and then I went in and refined how it lived in each person's body so it felt real.\n\nRAPP: That became such an iconic image of the cast.\n\nRUBIN-VEGA: Seeing it on the cover of the Arts and Leisure section of the New York Times is really what did it. It could be as iconic as f--- but the fact that that happened is what made it.\n\nHEREDIA: It always felt like every day that we were protecting the piece itself and that we had the privilege to carry on the message for Jonathan. It’s the most powerful image in the show.\n\nWALKER-BROWNE: I do remember enjoying the fact that we became a symbol for AIDS activism and activism in general. I work with a lot of young actors now, and many of them find their activism through Rent.\n\nWith its defiant, raw language, celebratory nature, and unique lyrics, “La Vie Bohème” went on to become one of the most beloved, oft-referenced numbers in the show.\n\nGREIF: It's about community. There's a common cause — there’s something to worry about, there's something to defeat, and there's something to celebrate.\n\nHEREDIA: When you sing that song in a group, you know that you are not alone. It's a victory chant. It's solidarity chanting, “We the freaks,” and it's all right to be that.\n\nWALKER-BROWNE: I use, “The opposite of war isn't peace, it's creation,” constantly. Because it's true, creation is such an act of love.\n\nPASCAL: I definitely would've thought this was going to be a difficult song for people to connect to. I can now in hindsight look back and understand it's such a joyous, fun number to watch. The audience wants to be part of that, which is ironic because this is a group of people who are marginalized from everybody else.\n\nRAPP: It so perfectly captures one of the major themes of the show, which is that in the face of the most difficult circumstances, it is still possible, and essential, to come together as a community. And to remember that this moment right now is the one that matters the most.\n\nRelated content:"}

At least some key people on the program have starting thinking about what would be a momentous occasion. When we asked executive producer Matt Van Wagenen in May 2019 while out on location for Winners at War whether the show would make it to the big 5-0, he was emphatic. “Hell yes!” replied the EP. When we asked challenge producers John Kirhoffer (who has been with the show since season 1) and Chris Marchand, they had the exact same response from each other: “I think we’ll make it to 50.”\n\nHowever, the one person who is not ready to commit to hitting that magic number is host and showrunner Jeff Probst. Even before the coronavirus pandemic that has shut down society and thrown the availability of season 41 in the fall into doubt, Probst was cagey when asked on location during Winners at War if Survivor would make it to season 50. “I don’t know,” responds Probst. “I will say that there is a complicated math idea on the board in there for [season] 41 or 42 which I’m trying to figure out, but I don’t know.”\n\nProbst does acknowledge the loyalty of Survivor Nation, but says it’s possible that changing winds at CBS could eventually win out. “It also does come down to not just our audience, but network television,” says Probst. “What’s happening? You look at ratings, we’ve been super lucky. Our ratings are holding. Our audience is so frickin’ loyal, man. They hang in there with us. And this is what has happened with Survivor for the last decade. We’re like this [makes straight line with hand], other shows come and they skyrocket and 'Oh, this is the new show,' and [uses other hand to show another line going up, leveling off, and then dropping down] then they do this and they then do this and then they do that. And we just stay like this. We barely drop.”\n\nWith steep viewership declines the norm due to fragmented viewership, the rise of streaming platforms, and more entertainment options than ever, Probst points out that staying flat or mild ratings declines — “In television today, that’s like getting a raise. And every year I look at the numbers and I think, the same people are watching. And so our job is deliver the same thing, only very different every time. We must reinvent. We must innovate. We must keep you curious, so you can sit home and think ‘Oh, I don’t think I’m going to like this. I don’t get the, what’s it called, the Edge of Extinction? Not for me. Island of the Idols? It seems like a little corny deal.’ But we keep doing it, and I feel people say, ‘Okay I’m starting to get it. What are these Fire Tokens again? How do they work?’ Just give it a second. We’re trying it out. We’ll see if it works. So that’s our job. So we can only do that season by season.”\n\nBut while Probst tried his best to paint Survivor’s future as a network decision, I told him I believed it was more a Jeff Probst decision, and that the future of the reality show may rest on how much longer the face of the franchise wants to keep at it. So does he want to do Survivor for five more years? “At this point, yes,” says the host. “But I don’t like the pressure being that it’s all on me. That doesn’t feel great. I want to do it because we as a group want to keep doing it and keep finding ways to reinvent it.”\n\nFor Probst, it is that constant reinvention and evolution that keeps him excited about a show he has already guided for two decades: “The thing that keeps me up at night is ‘What, are we going to do next?’ It’s why I’m sensitive to the constant criticism of ‘Well, I don’t know if I like that idea. Well, I’m not sure if I like that.’ ‘Cause you want to say, ‘Well, what’s your idea? What should we do?’ And then people pitch and you go, ‘Yeah, here’s why that doesn’t work.’”\n\nThe twist Probst is most excited about moving forward is the introduction of Fire Tokens in season 40. “The thing that keeps us going is when we get a hold of a new idea, like the idea of a Fire Token and then the idea of a currency,” he says. “We get excited because we go, a currency, even though it’s not sexy, it’s a foundation. Maybe we can build on that. Maybe the next 10 seasons can be building on now Survivor has a currency. There’s a mayor of Survivor. Oh my God, that guy’s a billionaire on Survivor. He has so many Fire Tokens. But he has no friends. He can’t buy anything. It’s crazy! He literally has all the money, and nobody will work with him! And then you’re once again in this microcosm of society and you’ve got something. That’s what we’re trying to figure out.”\n\nHopefully they will still be figuring it out in season 50.\n\nTo watch Probst discuss the future of Survivor, what the video at the top of the post.

(To put that in perspective, the first Trolls earned about $116 million in its first three weeks of theatrical release.) In the article, Shell indicated that Universal plans to release future films in theaters and on demand simultaneously, as soon as it is once again feasible to do so.\n\n\"The results for Trolls World Tour have exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the viability of PVOD,\" Shell told the Journal. \"As soon as theaters reopen, we expect to release movies on both formats.\"\n\nAMC, which is the largest theater chain in the world, responded with a strongly worded letter from CEO Adam Aron. Addressed to Universal Filmed Entertainment Group chairman Donna Langley, the letter calls Shell's comments \"categorically unacceptable\" and mandates that AMC will refuse to screen Universal's films going forward.\n\n\"It is disappointing to us, but Jeff's comments as to Universal's unilateral actions and intentions have left us with no choice,\" Aron wrote. \"Therefore, effectively immediately AMC will no longer play any Universal movies in any of our theaters in the United States, Europe or the Middle East.\"\n\nMovie theaters usually require a 90-day window for films to play on their screens before heading to VOD and digital platforms. As the coronavirus pandemic has forced theaters worldwide to close, however, studios have been releasing select movies directly to these platforms, skipping theatrical runs altogether.\n\n\"AMC believes that with this proposed action to go to the home and theatres simultaneously, Universal is breaking the business model and dealings between our two companies,\" Aron wrote in the letter. \"It assumes that we will meekly accept a reshaped view of how studios and exhibitors should interact, with zero concern on Universal's part as to how its actions affect us. It also presumes that Universal in fact can have its cake and eat it too, that Universal film product can be released to the home and theatres at the same time, without modification to the current economic arrangements between us.\n\n\"AMC has invested significant time and energy with Universal executives over the past few years trying to figure out a new windows model that would be beneficial both for your studio and for our theatre operations,\" Aron continued. \"While Universal's unilateral pronouncements on this issue are unpalatable to us, as has always been the case, AMC is willing to sit down with Universal to discuss different windows strategies and different economic models between your company and ours. However, in the absence of such discussions, and an acceptable conclusion thereto, our decades of incredibly successful business activity together has sadly come to an end.\"\n\nThe National Association of Theatre Owners also responded to Shell's remarks, issuing a statement that said Trolls World Tour's VOD success \"should not be interpreted as a sign of a 'new normal' for Hollywood.\"\n\n\"This performance is indicative of hundreds of millions of people isolated in their homes seeking entertainment, not a shift in consumer movie viewing preferences,\" the statement added. \"It is not surprising that people under shelter-in-home ordinances for weeks on end with increasingly limited entertainment options would take advantage of the movie's direct-to-VOD move to keep children entertained, even at a premium price.\"\n\nA Universal spokesperson said in a statement provided to EW, \"Our goal in releasing Trolls: World Tour on PVOD was to deliver entertainment to people who are sheltering at home, while movie theatres and other forms of outside entertainment are unavailable. Based on the enthusiastic response to the film, we believe we made the right move. We absolutely believe in the theatrical experience and have made no statement to the contrary. As we stated earlier, going forward, we expect to release future films directly to theatres, as well as on PVOD when that distribution outlet makes sense. We look forward to having additional private conversations with our exhibition partners but are disappointed by this seemingly coordinated attempt from AMC and NATO to confuse our position and our actions.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that despite pivoting to VOD in several cases, studios have chosen to reschedule the theatrical releases for the majority of their high-profile films. Universal, for instance, pushed the release of the upcoming Fast & Furious film F9 almost a full year, from May 22, 2020, to April 2, 2021.\n\nRelated content:"}

A revisionist take on the 1940s studio system, it follows a group of young, aspiring artists as they chase their dreams and work to dismantle a system built to exclude them.\n\nAhead of the show hitting Netflix on May 1, we remotely gathered the cast for a special \"At Home\" edition of our Around the Table series. The team gathered over Zoom to talk everything from where they wish they could be gathering for cocktails (hint: it involves Patti LuPone's basement) to the secret to mastering a Mid-Atlantic accent.\n\n\"I like how Ryan called it 'faction,' the mixture of real characters and real situations, but how the changes that are being made now, what would happen if they were changed then?\" Weaving explains of the show. \"It is eerily similar how much hasn't changed at the same time.\"\n\nThe series gave the cast the opportunity to delve into films and history of the era, everything from biographies of studio heads to the oeuvre of Rock Hudson. \"I became obsessed with Old Hollywood,\" LuPone marvels. \"Every time we were some place, I'm looking around for what is left.\"\n\nParsons was one of the few of the core cast to play a real figure from history, which heightened his own experience. \"It ended up being a very moving experience to me because Henry was somebody who was a gay man in that time, but it was nice to be able to have several little anecdotes that he had partaken in that gave a lot of color to how I felt about what we were doing,\" he reflects.\n\nThat classic ethos began even with the cast's auditions. Samara Weaving explains that the initial sides she got for the project were script pages from Billy Wilder classic Some Like It Hot, and she had no idea what she was auditioning for until being offered the role.\n\nHarrier had a similar experience with sides simply labeled \"Old Hollywood\" before being called in for chemistry read with Criss. \"Do you remember how nervous I was?\" asks Criss, \"It was such a joke. This is so stupid. We had three actresses and this is their day and I was trying to keep it cool. But this is a very Hollywood moment, where I'd never done a chemistry read before. That whole scenario I felt really nervous for the girls and whatever nerves they might have had or not had manifested in my own body.\"\n\nHarrier reassures him, \"It helped because you were so nervous it made me less nervous but you already had the part.\"\n\nImage zoom SAEED ADYANI/NETFLIX\n\nFrom learning how to rock a fedora to mastering the art of the Mid-Atlantic accent, Hollywood required the entire cast to enmesh themselves in the era. \"I was very intimidated by this Mid-Atlantic accent because what I didn't realize is, I just thought that's how people talked back then because that's how everyone's speaking in movies, but they didn't. They talked like us,\" Harrier says.\n\nShe and much of the cast had to go through \"starlet training\" similar to what their characters experience on-screen. \"Once you have it down, it's really fun. It really created the period,\" she reflects.\n\nPicking and Parsons had the extra challenge of having to adjust their dialect and improvise while wearing fake teeth. \"They were a little hard to get used to,\" says Picking, while Parsons adds, \"The teeth were a struggle.\"\n\nAh, the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.

The autobiography offers insight into the intricacies that led to the events on August 6, 2004, the night she killed Johnny Allen, 43, who picked up the teenager in his truck with the intention of having sex with her for $150. Brown, who was being trafficked by a man she considered her boyfriend at the time, claimed she shot Allen in self-defense.\n\nMurder to Mercy takes viewers through Brown's court case, where she was tried as an adult even though she was under 18. The book gets into her life behind bars and her decision to follow sage advice from her attorney that she should get involved with the right people and fill up her days studying and avoiding drugs and fights.\n\nWhile incarcerated, Brown earned a G.E.D., an associate's degree in Liberal Arts, and a bachelor's degree in Professional Studies in Organization Leadership — the latter two from Lipscomb University, both with a 4.0 G.P.A. She also used her time to help other young women suffering a similar fate, which inspired her to create the advocacy program G.L.I.T.T.E.R., which stands for Grassroots Learning Initiative on Teen Trafficking, Exploitation, and Rape.\n\nMurder to Mercy documentarian Daniel Birman released a previous documentary through PBS titled Me Facing Life: Cyntoia's Story that helped expose her case to a wider audience. So wide, in fact, that it captured the attention of celebrities including T.I., Rihanna, and Kim Kardashian, who helped spark the #FreeCynoia movement.\n\nAfter multiple appeals were denied, Brown's only hope for freedom was for then-Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam to grant her clemency. It was a lengthy process but well worth it, her sentence was commuted and she was released on August 7, 2019, with ten years probation plus time served (15 years).\n\nToday, Brown is married and living in Tennessee where she continues to advocate on behalf of trafficking victims like Chrystul Kizer, who at 17 was charged with first-degree homicide and arson in the death of her 33-year-old alleged rapist. She also travels the country to discuss prison reform and the problems with the criminal justice system.\n\nIn February, she testified in front of the Tennessee Senate Judiciary Committee in support of state Senator Raumesh Akbari's bill SB 69 that hopes to lessen the time a prisoner convicted of first-degree murder has to wait before becoming eligible for parole.\n\nEarlier the same month, she visited with trafficking victims in Washington, D.C., in collaboration with local organization Fair Girls.\n\nBrown shared in a recently deleted Twitter post that she's in the process of telling her story her own way.\n\nBrown's 2019 book will be available to purchase in paperback format on May 5.\n\nRelated content:"}

(1:40)\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. -- Brett Favre thinks Aaron Rodgers will follow the same career path that he did and finish his career elsewhere now that the Green Bay Packers selected quarterback Jordan Love in the first round of the NFL draft last week.\n\n\"I think he'll play somewhere else,\" Favre said Wednesday on NBC Sports Network, cutting off host Rich Eisen before he could even finish the question.\n\nSo Rodgers won't end his career with the Packers?\n\n\"My gut tells me no,\" Favre said. \"I don't know this for certain, but I guarantee you, it's got the wheels turning in Aaron's mind. If that's the case, then that means there's a chip on his shoulder toward the organization that otherwise was not there. All he needs is a reason other than this reason to expedite that.\"\n\nRodgers has four years remaining on his $134 million contract extension signed in 2018. For salary-cap purposes, he's virtually untradable until after the 2021 season.\n\nFavre said he's talked with Rodgers since the Packers traded up four spots to pick Love at No. 26 on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about all that we talked about, but he was ... let's just say surprised that they went in that direction,\" Favre said.\n\nRodgers has not spoken publicly since the draft, but Love told ESPN's Maria Taylor that he has spoken with Rodgers. A source told ESPN that Rodgers initiated the call.\n\nFavre and Rodgers, who have become better friends since Favre's career ended, got off to a rocky start when the Packers picked Rodgers in the first round of the 2005 draft. Rodgers served as Favre's backup for three seasons.\n\n\"I'm not surprised that he reached out to Jordan, being in a similar situation himself 15 years ago,\" Favre said. \"And we had a great relationship in spite of -- I wouldn't say it took a turn for the worst when I left, but he was basically caught up in the middle of a hornet's nest, if you will. I don't foresee that happening here. I think Aaron will do whatever. It's not his job to mentor Jordan Love.\n\n\"This discussion went on when I left Green Bay. It's not the head guy's job to mentor the next guy. That guy's ultimately there to take your spot. Now, if Jordan were to ask, 'Can I watch extra film with you?' I would be shocked if Aaron said no. I think he would go over and beyond to help, but he's not going to go out of his way, and I can't blame him.\"\n\nThe Packers have faced criticism for not only taking a quarterback when Rodgers has four years left on his contract, but also for not doing more to upgrade the offense around Rodgers. In a draft where a record 36 receivers were taken, the Packers took none despite coming within a game of the Super Bowl last season under first-year coach Matt LaFleur.\n\n\"Green Bay's not going anywhere without Aaron Rodgers in the next few years,\" Favre said. \"If he plays like we expect him to play, they've got a shot with or without a first-round receiver. So I would do all I could to not burn that bridge, and I don't think they did that. I think they burned a bridge that's going to be hard to overcome. At some point, I think it will rear its ugly head.\"\n\nFavre said the Packers should be one of the teams \"playing for now.\"\n\n\"They don't draft any weapons, not just in the first round, but any weapons that can help immediately, to my knowledge. And that just sends a disrespectful message to Aaron Rodgers,\" Favre said. \"He has every right to be disappointed if he is.\""}

Isiah's name never came up during that conversation. And he never backtracked and said he didn't want to do it from that time on, to those of us in the NBA office.\n\n\"Now, if that in fact happened, then it happened with somebody else; because when I talked to him, he ended up saying he would definitely do it.\"\n\nThomas reflected on his relationship with Jordan during a series of interviews Monday, one day after Episode 3 of the ESPN docuseries \"The Last Dance\" focused on the rivalry between Thomas' Detroit Pistons and Jordan's Chicago Bulls in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThomas told ESPN's Get Up that he has paid a \"heavy price\" for refusing the shake hands with Jordan and the Bulls after the 1991 Eastern Conference finals and said he would be extremely disappointed if the infamous snub was a factor in his omission from the Dream Team.\n\n\"I thought I should've made that Dream Team,\" Thomas said Monday. \"However, I wasn't a part of it -- that hurt me.\n\n\"Looking back, if I'm not a part of the Dream Team because a lapse in emotion in terms of not shaking someone's hand -- if that's the reason why I didn't make the Dream Team, then I am more disappointed today than I was back then when I wasn't selected.\"\n\nThorn was a member of the selection committee for the Dream Team, which rolled to the gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.\n\nHe said he personally called Jordan and that Thomas never was brought up in their conversation. He also said no other players on the Dream Team mentioned Thomas to him.\n\n\"My conversation with Michael was strictly about Michael, about Michael playing,\" Thorn said. \"Obviously, the committee was hopeful that Michael would play, because he was the No. 1 player in the league at that time and the No. 1 player in the world and the most popular player in the world at that time.\n\n\"But he didn't say anything to me about [Thomas], and I certainly had no reason to bring it up either.\"\n\nThorn was asked why Thomas was not on the roster, assuming Jordan had no input.\n\n\"That's a good question, because Isiah was a great player, a fantastic player,\" Thorn said. \"There was some controversy with the Pistons regarding not shaking hands with the Bulls -- there was some bad blood, obviously, there. ... But when we ended up going with the first 10 guys, he did not end up making the team.\"\n\nThorn also mentioned James Worthy, Reggie Miller and Dominique Wilkins as notable NBA stars who did not make the Dream Team, saying the selection committee had a \"long list of players that we initially looked at.\"\n\nThorn was the Bulls' general manager from 1978 to 1985 and oversaw the team's selection of Jordan in the 1984 draft. He said Jordan initially balked at participating in the 1992 Games.\n\n\"I was the guy that called Jordan,\" Thorn said. \"And when I called Jordan, his first inclination was he didn't know if he wanted to play or not -- because, as he said, 'I played on an Olympic team before' with Bobby Knight in Los Angeles. ... And so we continued the conversation, and at the end of the conversation, he said, 'You know something? I'll do it.'\""}

(1:23)\n\nMETAIRIE, La. -- Jameis Winston has proudly boasted for years that he was the first kid to get an autograph from Drew Brees after Brees joined the New Orleans Saints in 2006. Winston, who had just turned 12 at the time, grew up near Birmingham, Alabama, where Brees was rehabbing from shoulder surgery at the time.\n\nSadly, Winston admitted Wednesday that he lost that autographed picture. But now the 26-year-old will get an even better experience -- learning from Brees firsthand after signing a one-year deal with the Saints.\n\n\"There's only a few people in this league that actually follow up with you when you ask them a question, when you reach out to them,\" said Winston, who said he also got the chance to spend time with Brees before he was drafted in 2015 at the Rock Church in San Diego. \"And ever since then, he's always been a guy that I can hit up during the season and ask a question, and he'll get back with me.\n\n\"So I just love the person that he is and the guy that he is, and I'm so excited to learn from him and help serve him in any way.\"\n\nWithout naming any specific teams, Winston said he did have other opportunities that might have paid him more money or given him a better chance to start. His deal with the Saints is worth $1.1 million, with another $3.4 million in available incentives, a source told ESPN's Field Yates.\n\nBut Winston said he took this opportunity to work with Brees, coach Sean Payton and others \"in a heartbeat.\"\n\n\"When you have an opportunity to work with a coach who is as successful and as smart as Sean Payton, and work with a quarterback who will be -- whenever he decides to retire, he's probably getting escorted to the Hall of Fame, I don't think you really can beat that. Especially if you believe in yourself,\" Winston said. \"If you believe in the ability that you have, really if you have faith that you will become a starting quarterback again, you take this opportunity in a heartbeat, to work with this amazing group of men.\n\n\"Being a quarterback, you have to be a student of the game. So now, I actually get a chance to dive into that more, and I actually have a Hall of Fame quarterback that I'm learning from, as opposed to trying to learn by myself or use Google.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he thinks that future starting opportunity could come with the Saints after the 41-year-old Brees retires, Winston said he is not looking that far ahead.\n\n\"I'm focused on this primary opportunity,\" Winston said. \"The primary opportunity is getting a chance to work with Drew Brees, Sean Payton, Taysom Hill and Tommy Stevens, and (quarterbacks coach Joe) Lombardi and (offensive coordinator Pete) Carmichael and (offensive assistant D.J.) Williams. ... And we'll be able to have that conversation next year or years down the road. Who knows, we don't know. I didn't think I was gonna be in this position this time last year, but God had a different plan, and I'm excited for the plan he has for me moving forward.\"\n\nWinston talked Tuesday on an Instagram Live video with fellow former Florida State quarterback Charlie Ward about how he wanted to put his ego and the money to the side. And he referenced a proverb that suggests \"humility comes before honor.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Winston also referenced the recent Disney animated movie \"Onward,\" which he said he watched recently with his 1-year-old son.\n\n\"That's just an amazing word. And that's what I'm doing. I'm pressing onward,\" said the former No. 1 overall draft pick, who has readily acknowledged the improvements he needs to make in his game.\n\nAlthough Winston led the NFL with 5,109 passing yards last season, he also became the first quarterback in league history to throw for at least 30 touchdown passes and 30 interceptions. That led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to sign Tom Brady as a replacement.\n\nWinston has already taken steps to improve physically this offseason. He had LASIK surgery in February, which he said has removed the blurriness from far-away objects like street signs and license plates. He downplayed the significance of the knee scope that he had after the season -- pointing to his Instagram workout videos as evidence. But he did say that after that surgery in Birmingham, he began working with one of Brees' longtime mentors -- physical therapist Kevin Wilk. And Wilk and Dr. Jeffrey Dugas, who performed the surgery, encouraged Winston to get healthier through a vegan diet.\n\n\"So I've been vegan for the past four months, and it's just changed my body drastically,\" Winston said -- though he admitted, \"I do cheat every Saturday.\"\n\nWinston also got married last month to his longtime girlfriend, Breion Allen, whose extended family just happens to be from the New Orleans area.\n\n\"And when you have a happy wife, you have a happy life,\" Winston said. \"So that's pretty big.\""}

The virtual event will be streamed to a live audience.\n\nIt's another attempt to keep tennis in the public eye at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has shut down the professional game until at least July 13.\n\nWilliams is playing with supermodel Gigi Hadid while, among others, Naomi Osaka partners with model and TV personality Hailey Bieber, Sharapova teams with model Karlie Kloss, Kei Nishikori joins DJ and producer Steve Aoki, and Anderson partners with Tennessee Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill. The competitors will play the game in their homes, all for the same $25,000 sum that they will then donate to the charity of their choice. The winning team will receive an additional $1 million to donate.\n\nViewers will be able to watch avatars playing, along with live feeds from the athletes in their homes. ESPN analyst John McEnroe and YouTube personality Justine Ezarik will provide commentary. The event will be streamed on Facebook Gaming and the IMG Tennis Facebook page.\n\nThis will be the second video game tournament featuring professional ATP and WTA players within a week and is part of the game's evolving response to the lockdown. The Madrid Open, a staple of the spring European clay-court circuit, was to begin Monday. When it was canceled because of the pandemic, the promoters created the video game version of the event. Currently ongoing, it ends Thursday.\n\nThe Madrid virtual event immediately featured an art-imitating-life component, as Gael Monfils withdrew citing injury and Belinda Bencic pranced into her living room -- racket bag and all -- to the Joan Jett classic \"I Love Rock 'N' Roll.\"\n\nNot so familiar: Dominic Thiem, the real-world ATP No. 3, and No. 15 Karen Khachanov both were eliminated because they experienced internet connectivity problems.\n\nSince the coronavirus lockdown began, tennis players have been all over social media, posting numerous challenges and feats of athletic skill with the hashtag #tennisathome. The interest in gaming also appears to be gaining traction as a way for players to remain connected with their fans while raising money for charitable causes. The Madrid Open is offering some $325,000 in prize money, with the players ultimately deciding how much of the pot to distribute to lower-ranked peers who are struggling financially.\n\nLower-ranked tennis players, who are independent contractors dependent mostly on tournament prize money for their income, have been particularly hard hit by all the canceled events. Social distancing and the mandated closure of non-essential businesses has prohibited them from even giving lessons.\n\nAt the same time, traditional tennis is slowly making its way back in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The Base Tennis Academy in Hohr-Grenzhausen is hosting an eight-player exhibition starting Friday.\n\nThe matches in the Tennis Point Exhibition Series will be played indoors, with only three people on the court: the chair umpire and the two players. It will be live-streamed by Tennis Channel. When not on court, the players will have to wear masks.\n\nOngoing travel restrictions dictated that the players in the exhibition would be local, low-ranked pros. But the field of ATP journeymen is led by Dustin Brown. A crowd favorite due to his electric, slashing game, Brown has fallen to a ranking of No. 239, but he has an unforgettable Wimbledon upset of Rafael Nadal on his résumé. The eight men will play 32 matches with an abbreviated scoring system.\n\nPatrick Mouratoglou, Williams' coach and an ESPN analyst, is planning a similar event at his eponymous tennis academy in the south of France. The tournament, which has been projected as a five-week event, is more proof that while in-home fitness routines and video game tournaments are valuable diversions, there is a real hunger -- and no adequate substitute -- for getting back on the court and competing."}

(1:48)\n\nOWINGS MILLS, Md. -- Will Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson make history with his legs once again? Las Vegas oddsmakers certainly think so.\n\nThe over-under for Jackson's rushing total for the 2020 regular season opened at 999.5 yards at Caesars Sportsbook.\n\nJackson rushed for 1,206 yards in 2019 -- a single-season record for a quarterback -- en route to being named NFL MVP. However, each of the previous three quarterbacks to rush for more than 900 yards in a season recorded less than 600 rushing yards the following year.\n\nJackson said last week that it didn't matter how much he ran the ball, as long as it helped the Ravens win. He also predicted he wouldn't put up the same rushing numbers in 2020.\n\n\"I doubt that I am going to be carrying the ball a lot going further into the future, because we have dynamic running backs and even more receivers,\" Jackson said. \"We are going to be pretty good, and I don't think I'll be running a lot.\"\n\nJackson had similar expectations heading into last season, saying he thought he would run the ball less before ultimately breaking Michael Vick's single-season record. He has repeatedly talked about how he enjoys passing the ball and famously said \"not bad for a running back\" after throwing five touchdown passes in last season's opener.\n\nOne of the most dynamic runners in the game, Jackson spun, faked out and ran past defenders to finish last season as the NFL's sixth-leading rusher, which surpassed Vegas' expectations. Jackson's preseason rushing over-under at Caesars opened at 867.5 yards, which he surpassed in Week 12.\n\nFor dual-threat quarterbacks, posting big back-to-back rushing seasons has proven elusive. Randall Cunningham ran for 942 yards in 1990 but managed just 549 the next season. Vick rushed for 902 yards in 2004 but was limited to 597 the following year. After Vick established the quarterback rushing record in 2006 with 1,039 yards, he didn't play the following season after being convicted on dogfighting charges.\n\nThis year, the other prop bet for Jackson is his passing over-under, which opened at 3,199.5 yards; he passed for 3,127 last season. If Jackson goes over on both prop bets, he would become the first player in league history with 3,200 yards passing and 1,000 rushing yards in a season.\n\nIn other prop bets, the highest over-unders are 4,499.5 passing yards for Patrick Mahomes, 1,249.5 rushing yards for Christian McCaffrey and 1,449.5 receiving yards for Michael Thomas.\n\nESPN's Ben Fawkes contributed to this report."}

Yes, several first-round picks will be guaranteed starters come Week 1, but the best teams find multiple starters throughout their class.\n\nLet's evaluate the rookies from each day of the draft who will make an early impact. This is more about having a clear role than coming in and dominating.\n\nHere are 15 rookies selected in Rounds 1-7 who will have an immediate impact:\n\nMore NFL draft coverage:\n\nGrades: Kiper on all 32 teams\n\nDay 2 recap: Picks I liked\n\nRound 1 winners, questions\n\nKiper's top 300 rankings\n\nInstant-impact rookies from Round 1\n\nThese are five fits I liked from Day 1 of the draft:\n\nPick: No. 2\n\nOK, let's start with an easy one. Pass-rushers have a great chance to make an early impact. Just last season, rookie edge rushers Josh Allen and Maxx Crosby topped 10 sacks, Nick Bosa had nine (and four more in the playoffs), and Young's new teammate Montez Sweat had seven. Washington's front seven is loaded with former first-rounders, but the defense ranked 26th in the league in pressure percentage last season (26%), and it struggled to get to quarterbacks on third down. Expect Young to rotate at defensive end with Sweat and veteran Ryan Kerrigan.\n\nMy top-ranked prospect overall since last September, Young dominated for the Buckeyes last season, with 16.5 sacks and six forced fumbles. He has a unique blend of size (6-foot-5, 264 pounds), athleticism and veteran technique, and he could get double-digit sacks in his first season. I love the fit in Washington, where new coach Ron Rivera and coordinator Jack Del Rio take over a talented defense.\n\nPick: No. 32"}

IGN will cover the world premiere so check back on the site tomorrow.\n\n\n\nWatch the World Premiere of Assassin's Creed Valhalla April 30th at 8am PDT / 5pm CEST. #AssassinsCreed — Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) April 29, 2020\n\nOriginal story follows.\n\nA History of Assassin's Creed Leaks 14 IMAGES\n\nThe setting for the next Assassin's Creed game – rumoured to be set in the Viking era – will be revealed in a stream today.Ubisoft has kicked off a stream hosted by digital artist Bosslogic, who'll create a \"unique art piece\" that will reveal the setting. We'll be updating this post as the day goes on, noting anything we learn from the art below.You can watch the stream on Twitter YouTube and Twitch The image is now clearly in two halves, showing a frozen-looking shore on the left, and a more vibrant countryside on the right. That could signify the Vikings' raiding journeys from Scandinavia to warmer countries in the south.The first major addition to the image is a large stone castle, which would seem to lend some credence to the idea of an Assassin's Creed game set in the Middle Ages - although stone castles first emerged in Europe towards the very end of the Viking Age, around 1,000 CE.The left side of the image now features a couple of boats that look very much like Viking longships, while the right side features a battle between two differently armoured sides. A Viking game feels more and more likely.The latest major changes have involved turning that once-proud castle into a ruin, and adding a lot of detail to the background battlers. The cloaked combatants seem to be armed and armoured like Anglo Saxon warriors , who repeatedly defended against Viking invasions in Britain.The central figure is starting to get more detailed. BossLogic is painting in their belt which clearly showcases some nordic engravings and design patterns. With the background mostly complete, all that's left is the central character.Artist BossLogic finished the Assassin's Creed painting revealing its viking-era setting. Ubisoft confirmed the title for the new assassin game will be called Assassin's Creed Valhalla with a full reveal premiering tomorrow at 8 am PT/11 am ET. Check out the full complete artwork below.\n\nThe next Assassin's Creed game is widely rumoured to centre around Vikings , so we could potentially see a Middle Ages setting emerge over the course of the stream – the Viking Age is a time period lasting from 800 CE to 1066 CE. Rumours have suggested that the game is subtitled (or code named) Kingdom or Ragnarok. The Division 2 may have already teased that setting , given it included Assassin's Creed's Apple of Eden artifact placed suspiciously close to the word 'Valhalla'.\n\nIf that does turn out to be the case we'd be in favour of that move, as we think a Viking-based game could bring the franchise full circle.\n\nJoe Skrebels is IGN's Executive Editor of News, and he wants to go to Jorvik Viking Centre as research.

After the update there’s a chance you’ll come across something called the “ Red Access Card .” While the in-game icon lists it as a health item, it currently serves no immediate purpose.The loot item doesn’t provide any new abilities or open any kind of lock just yet, but there’s speculation that this is a teaser for an upcoming event of some kind. Considering the update went live today, it might be some time before we figure out the true purpose of this new item.As a note, Call of Duty players on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will need to download a data pack for the new patch. After installing the update, select a mode (multiplayer, campaign, Special Operations, etc.) and players will be taken to an install menu where they can download Data Pack 1. Afterward, they’ll need to hard close and re-open Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Here’s a full list of updates in today’s patch via InfinityWard\n\nMatt Kim is a reporter for IGN."}

This PC is customizable on HP's website, but buying the base config has its merits. In terms of gaming, upgrading from an Intel Core i5-9600K to an Intel Core i7 is a waste... performance-wise they are identical. Also, by upgrading the RAM and storage on your own, you can save alot of money and pick your own, better parts at the same time. It's hard enough to find an RTX 2080-equipped gaming laptop for under $2000, but this one doesn't skip on any other spec either. In fact, you get a true 4K 3840x2160 display, a 9th gen Intel Core i7 processor, and plenty of RAM and SSD storage. If anything, a 17\" display would be put to better use with a massive 4K resolution bump. Fortunately, the RTX 2080-equipped OMEN 17 is the exact same price as the OMEN 15. This laptop is every bit as good for gaming but you'll save about $350 compared to the above config. The RTX 2070 video card is almost as powerful as the previous generation's GTX 1080, which used to be the most powerful mobile GPU. It should be more than enough handle any game on the 15\" 1080p display, even at 144Hz refresh rate. If you want to, you can upgrade to 12GB RAM and 512GB SSD for $180. PS Plus membership discounts only happen a few times a year so grab this deal when you can. This membership lets you play games online (absolutely necessary for games like NBA 2K20, Madden NFL 20, FIFA 20, Overwatch, Rocket League, and more). You'll also get PS Plus exclusive discounts at the PlayStation Store as well as new free games every month. For example, right now PS Plus members get the outstanding Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and Dirt Rally 2.0 for free. Best of all, it's email delivery so you'll get your code within 24 hours. Pay $1/month for four months (the normal cost of the HiFi plan is $19.99/mo). TIDAL is a music streaming service that offers 60+ million tracks and 250,000+ videos with premium quality audio. The HiFi plan upgrades the audio to lossless high-fidelity. Why don't you complement your slick gaming PC with an equally slick gaming desk. This one normally sells for $360 but you can get the black and blue model for $155 less. The desk features an edge-stitched 5mm thick mouse pad on the entire desktop surface, heavy duty metal height adjustable legs, and integrated cord management. The ComiXology trial period is normally 30 days. ComiXology is Amazon's digital comic platform and is the largest digital retailer of American comics. The site hosts 20,000 digital comics, graphic novels, and manga from DC, Marvel, Image, Dark Horse, and more. Here's your chance to access all of it, totally free, for60 days. If you're an avid comic reader, you might want to consider continuing on afterwards, since it's only $5.99/month. You can even sign in with your Amazon account. This is the lowest price ever, even lower than on Black Friday, and it ends very soon. These are truly wireless AirPods with built-in active noise cancellation and despite that that they actually have longer play time on a single charge than the vanilla AirPods. Other features include three sets of silicone tips for customized fit, a sweat and water resistant outer shell, and a wireless charging case that can provide an additional 24 hours of battery life. Starting now, Verizon Wireless has discounted the 2nd generation Apple AirPods down to Black Friday prices. You can get it with a charging case (which charges via Lightning cable) for only $135.99, or with a wireless charging case (which charges via inductive Qi charging or Lightning cable) for $169.99. The AirPods 2 is a truly wireless headphone with Siri support and 50% longer talk time than the original AirPods. This gaming PC boasts a 9th gen Intel Core i7 processor and the newest RTX 2080 SUPER video card. It's about 10% more powerful than the non-SUPER model and considerably more powerful than the GTX 1080 Ti. For those of you who would rather have a PC preinstalled with all the RAM and storage you'll ever need, this model has 16GB RAM and dual drive storage. If you want upgrade the RAM and hard drive yourself, you can save alot of money compared to adding pre-configured upgrades. Like the new R9 chassis, the R8 features easy toolless entry. Swapping components doesn't void the warranty. For those of you who haven't been keeping up with the Intel vs AMD CPU war, AMD has been giving Intel a run for its money with its flagship processors. The new AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-core processor is comparable to the Intel Core i7-9700, both in terms of gaming and workstation performance. It's paired with an RX 5700 XT video card, which is on par with the RTX 2070. If you want to upgrade the RAM or hard drive, I'd suggest doing it on your own. You'll save money, and the Aurora R9 allows for toolless access without voiding your warranty. IPVanish is offering 73% off its 1 year VPN plan, dropping the price to $39. That's only $3.25 a month for a service that provides some great benefits. VPN is the first and easiest step to making your internet activity a bit more anonymous. VPN is also a great way to \"trick\" a host site into thinking you're in another part of the world. That's great for watching region-locked content from streaming services like Netflix. IPVanish boasts a very user-friendly interface, doesn't hog resources, and has a zero-log policy. We also gave it a great review Want to be more productive at home? Stack Social has plenty of practical courses that can kick start your career. For under $40 per bundle you get dozens of hours of online instruction in programming, game creation, video production, ethical hacking, and more... all from the safety of your home. This deal only works for new Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers, but. Normally you'd be paying $9.99/month for this service (or $7.99/mo for Prime members). Amazon Music Unlimited works alot like the paid ad-free versions of Spotify or Pandora. Get access to millions of songs and playlists that you can stream anywhere. Sling's Happy Hour promotion is offering free Sling Blue from 5pm to midnight (normally $30/month). You can keep up with live news about the COVID virus from CNN, MSNBC, HLN, and Fox News, or just lose yourself in family friendly TV shows from HGTV, Food Network, A&E, Bravo, TNT, Comedy Central, Cartoon Network, The Discovery Channel, Nick Jr, and more.

That top line led to $13 billion in operating income (+25% YoY), and $10.8 billion in net income (+22% YoY). Microsoft saw $1.40 in earnings per share in the quarter.\n\nInvestors had expected the company to report $1.26 in per-share profit off of revenue of $33.66 billion, according to Yahoo Finance. Right after reporting its results, Microsoft shares were up around 1.5%. The firm rallied 4.5% during regular trading hours on the back of a strong day of trading for technology equities.\n\nOther headlines from the company’s earnings report include Azure (its AWS competitor) growing 59% from its year-ago result, 25% growth in Office 365 commercial incomes, LinkedIn top line growing 21% from the year-ago period, and roughly flat results from its Xbox, search, and Surface businesses.\n\nHowever, calendar Q1 (Q3 F2020 for Microsoft) only included a portion of the world’s COVID-19 response. The results reflected that, with the company noting that “COVID-19 had minimal net impact” on revenue in the quarter, boosting cloud usage, lowering some advertising revenue from LinkedIn, raising gaming engagement, and slowing search advertising top line. The balance of that appears to be largely a wash.\n\nThe company will talk more about the future on its earnings call, but the firm did warn in its own report that “the effects of COVID-19 may not be fully reflected in the financial results until future periods.”\n\nMetrics\n\nIn case anyone else is interested in other metrics, we’ve collected the most interesting numbers from Microsoft’s earnings slides for your enjoyment. Here they are:\n\nQ3 F2020 aggregate gross margin: 69%, +2% YoY\n\nQ3 F2020 aggregate operating margin: 37%, +3% YoY\n\nThe company’s commercial bookings growth dropped sharply compared to preceding quarters; a portion of this was due to currency changes, which lowered growth in the category from 12% to 7% (YoY). The preceding lowest set of results since Q3 F2019 was that year’s Q4 which saw 22% growth (YoY) and 25% on a currency-adjusted basis.\n\nCommercial cloud revenue at Microsoft as $13.3 billion in the quarter, up 39% YoY. Remember when Microsoft wanted to hit a $20 billion run rate for commercial cloud revenue? Good times.\n\nLinkedIn got name-checked as a driver of rising operating expenses, which rose 10% to $11.1 billion; the only other category noted was cloud engineers. Which, to be clear, are expensive.\n\nMicrosoft returned $9.9 billion to shareholders in the quarter, and spent $3.9 billion on capital expenditures. (Why aren’t those flipped?)\n\nAnd finally, operating cash flow at the company was $17.5 billion in the quarter. Chew on that, startups.\n\nOn the whole it was a good quarter for the company, which didn’t take too much damage from COVID-19. Of course, its outlook will matter quite a lot when we get it. For now, investors are content."}

That’s not only helpful if you’re unlocking your phone dozens of times a day — which we all do — but it’s also helping to keep people safe by not forcing users to take off their masks and potentially exposing themselves to the virus.\n\nIt’s not known if this feature will land in the final version of the software update.

Johns Hopkins, building on its excellent work developing COVID-19 case tracking and basic information resources, has developed a new hub called the COVID-19 Testing Insights Initiative that breaks down what kinds of tests are available, as well as where they’re being administered in the U.S., and in what volume.\n\nThe new hub offers answers to commonly asked questions like how COVID-19 is currently diagnosed, what the differences are between the two major types of tests used (molecular and serological) and what is required for testing in terms of both payment and qualifying symptoms/exposure risk.\n\nCrucially, it also provides a state-by-state breakdown of how many tests have been performed, graphed against the total number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths in that state. They also provide a report on the weekly rate of change in positive tests across all states, showing whether there’s been an increase in the namer of positive tests or a decrease on a week-over-week basis, and in either case, by how much.\n\nJohns Hopkins notes that the data may not be consistent, since it’s being pulled from a number of publicly available sources, and it notes further that states themselves are not consistent. The school says it’s doing what it can to account for the irregularities that result from inconsistent reporting, but doesn’t want to misrepresent the data.\n\nThe overall picture of how many tests have been completed, as well as where and by who, along with positive results, has been a topic of a lot of confusion and debate. The White House has consistently provided numbers that are out of sync with the reality in terms of numbers reported by states, particularly when it comes to test volume.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins hub provides likely the best source yet for a good snapshot of the current state of testing on a state-by-state basis, and the resource will be updated regularly with new info as it becomes available. Widespread testing is a key ingredient in any effective COVID-19 control measures, and this should act as a sort of report card to provide an indicator how how well we’re doing on this front."}

The companies announced today they’ve renewed their agreement, which will allow Amazon Prime Video to offer a live, digital stream of Thursday Night Football to a global audience through the 2022 season. This time around, the NFL and Amazon also announced a new deal allowing Amazon to exclusively stream one NFL game globally on Prime Video and Twitch for each of the next three seasons.\n\nAmazon and the NFL have been partnered on streaming Thursday Night Football since 2017, initially with a one-year deal that was said to be valued at $50 million. The companies renewed that agreement in 2018 for two more years, valuing each season at $65 million (or $130 million in total).\n\nThe terms of this new deal weren’t disclosed, but an initial report from CNBC claims the deal price has been upped once again. That makes sense, of course, given the new agreement is not only arriving two years later but also now includes an exclusive game.\n\nOver time, the audience for the NFL games has grown slightly. The 2019 Thursday Night Football games delivered an average audience of 15.4 million viewers across all properties (broadcast, cable and digital), up 4+% from the 2018 games.\n\nDigital streams in 2019 surpassed an average minute audience of over 1 million, up 43% year-over-year (729K). This includes the streams across Prime Video, Twitch, NFL digital, FOX Sports digital and Verizon Media mobile properties. (Note: TechCrunch’s parent company is owned by Verizon).\n\nViewers will be able to stream the 11 Thursday Night Football games broadcast by FOX through the Prime Video and Twitch websites and apps across living room devices, mobile phones, tablets and PCs. That makes the games available to Amazon Prime’s more than 150 million worldwide users in over 200 countries and territories, Amazon notes.\n\nBut Amazon won’t be the only place to watch most of these games.\n\nThe games are also broadcast by FOX in Spanish on FOX Deportes, and will be simulcast on the NFL Network. This continues the league’s “Tri-Cast” strategy, which includes a combination of broadcast, cable and digital distribution.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon’s exclusively streamed game isn’t a Thursday Night Football game, but instead is a regular season game played on a Saturday in the second half of the season. This game will also be televised over-the-air in the participating teams’ home markets.\n\nAs before, the digital streams will include access to Amazon features like X-Ray and Next Gen Stats powered by AWS. Prime members can pick from either the FOX or FOX Deportes broadcast and from a range of alternative audio options exclusive to Prime Video.\n\nAmazon and the NFL will also collaborate on additional content and fan viewing experiences around the game streams in the future.\n\n“As our relationship has expanded, Amazon has become a trusted and valued partner of the NFL,” said Brian Rolapp, chief media and business officer for the NFL, in a statement. “Extending this partnership around Thursday Night Football continues our critical mission of delivering NFL games to as many fans in as many ways as possible both in the United States and around the world,” he added."}

Those massive cuts would amount to around a third of the Bay Area vaping giant’s entire workforce.\n\nWhile the news comes amid a deluge of layoff reports, Juul’s troubles are said not to be a direct result from the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather, they stem from larger ongoing problems. After all, it wouldn’t be the first time the company has made a sizable cut to its staff — in October, it laid off around 650 people.\n\nJuul wouldn’t confirm the specifics of the news, but does appear to acknowledge some big changes are afoot, as the company looks to restructure after struggles. “As part of our ongoing reset, we are constantly evaluating our operations and the best way to position our company for the long term,” it said in a statement. “We remain focused on earning the trust of our stakeholders to advance the potential for harm reduction for adult smokers while combating underage use.” According to reports, some of that evaluation comes in the form of figuring just how many jobs to cut. Figures are likely to be somewhere between one-quarter and 40% of its staff. A final decision will arrive “in the coming weeks.”\n\nA memo leaked to the press notes similar sentiments from CEO K.C. Crosthwaite, who writes:\n\n[W]e are continuing to evaluate our operations and the best way to position our company for the long term. We have made hard decisions over the last six months, and we still have hard decisions to make. You have my word that I will bring you all together when we have final decisions and details to announce.\n\nOngoing regulatory issues have become a major stumbling block for the company in recent years, along with a swift hit to sales. The company suffered a $1 billion loss last year — a steep drop after a rapid climb.\n\nWe’ve reached out for additional comment."}

The startup is aiming to insert itself as an essential service in the small business repertoire by bundling banking with payment services powered by Stripe. Customers can receive payments, manage their cash and pay employees all via Wise’s app.\n\nCEO Arjun Thyagarajan tells TechCrunch that his company has closed a $5.7 million seed round led by Base10 Partners . Abstract Ventures, Backend Capital, The Fund and Two Culture Capital also participated in the round.\n\nWhile the advent of challenger banks has helped drive plenty of innovation on the consumer banking side, says Rexhi Dollaku, a principal at Base10 who led the Wise deal, “very little of that innovation has happened in the business banking context.”\n\nThyagarajan and his investors hope that the startup can keep churn low by embedding a wider scope of financial services products inside its core product, expanding beyond the traditional scope of banking features by offering functionality to power things like payroll and accounting.\n\nRather than plunging into direct customer sales, Wise is partnering with behemoth platforms like Shopify to onboard small businesses where they already are. “If you look at other [banking] options out there, they’re going direct to the customer; what we’ve learned is that it is better to partner,” Thyagarajan says. “They’re signing up inside these ecosystems so we want to partner with these ecosystems.”\n\nThe small team has already built up a customer base of 1,000 businesses. The average Wise customer has between 2-10 employees and is pulling in somewhere between $500,000 and $5 million in ARR, the company tells us. Bank accounts on Wise’s platform are FDIC-insured up to $250,000 through the startup’s partnership with banking partner BBVA USA.\n\nWhile Thyagarajan says they’ve seen online spend increasing, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted plenty of Wise’s potential customers, and has pushed the company to stay flexible in the businesses they cater to. “I think a lot of industries are going to get accelerated and fast-forwarded,” he says. “The customers we want to cater to are rapidly modernizing.”\n\nAlongside the funding announcement, the startup shared that Raghav Lal, a former general manager of Small Business at Visa, will be joining the startup as its president."}

This is a developer-focused release, and is a seed of the API in development, with the primary intent of collecting feedback from developers who will be using the API to create new contact tracing and notification apps on behalf of public health agencies.\n\nLast week, Apple CEO Tim Cook told EU Commissioner Thierry Breton that the API would be arriving shortly, and this version is indeed now available — albeit to a specific and limited group that includes select developers working on behalf of public health authorities globally, according to the companies. This is a test release that’s intended to provide the opportunity for development and feedback in advance of the API’s public release in mid-May, at which time developers will be able to use the software feature on devices with publicly available apps released through the iOS and Google software stores, respectively.\n\nApple and Google say they will be providing this coming Friday additional details about the API and its release, including sample code to show how it operates in practice. Both are intent on providing updates to the documentation as they become available, and in adding access to new developers throughout testing, though this will be gated because the companies are limiting access to this API to authorized public health authorities only.\n\nAlready, Apple and Google have made available on their respective developer websites documents that describe the specification in detail, and provided an update with improvements to the tech’s functioning, including in terms of its protection of user privacy, and the ease with which developers can deploy it within their apps, as discussed during a press call last week.\n\nThis update includes an added ability for health authorities to define and calculate an exposure risk level for individuals based on their own criteria, as that varies organization to organization. This will be variable based on approximate distance of an individual to a confirmed exposed COVID-19 patient, as well as the duration of that exposure. Developers can customize notification messaging based on their defined exposure levels to ensure alerts correspond correctly to calculated risk.\n\nThe beta update also includes a new setting for users that allows them to toggle COVID-19 exposure notification access for individual apps, as pictured in the screenshot below.\n\nDe nieuwe bluetooth-technologie (api) voor corona-tracking is vanaf nu beschikbaar in de derde beta van iOS 13.5. Zo ziet de functie 'Covid-19 Exposure Notifications' er momenteel uit: pic.twitter.com/yci0jboz6H — Daniël Verlaan (@danielverlaan) April 29, 2020\n\nApple and Google first announced the combined API and eventual system-level contact tracing feature on April 10, and intend to release the first version of the API publicly in mid-May, with the system-level integration to follow in the coming months. The tech is designed to be privacy-preserving, ensuring that contact IDs are rotating and randomized, and never tied to an individual’s specific identifying information."}

The company reported 1.73 billion daily active users of its core Facebook platform, up 11% year over year, exceeding analysts expectations of 1.70 billion.\n\n\"We’re not immune to this crisis--we did see a steep decline in advertising revenue starting about the first week of March,” said David Wehner, Facebook’s financial chief, during a CNBC interview Wednesday afternoon. But the company said that advertising spending had stabilized during the first three weeks of April, with sales roughly flat year over year. Some had feared the advertising decline would be much more severe.\n\nThe crisis also will likely also lead Facebook to cut down on overall operational spending, Mr. Wehner said, with the company expecting to spend $52 billion to $56 billion in 2020, at least $2 billion less than previously expected, as the company cuts back on travel and events due to the pandemic.\n\nFacebook brought in $17.7 billion in revenue in the quarter, up from $15.1 billion a year ago.

Safra Center for Ethics argues the United States needs that many tests daily to keep the virus under control. Tests across the United States are running in the range of 130,000 to 160,000 a day, according to the Covid Tracking Project.\n\n“Well, it will increase it, and it’ll increase it by much more than that in the very near future,” Trump said Tuesday when asked about the 5 million figure.\n\nAsked to clarify whether that meant he was confident the United States would surpass 5 million tests per day, Trump replied: “Oh, well, we’re going to be there very soon. If you look at the numbers, it could be that we’re getting very close.”\n\nBut Wednesday, after some members of his administration cast doubt on the country’s ability to achieve that amount of testing per day, Trump appeared to distance himself from the statement. He argued that the 5 million number didn’t come from him but rather from others. “I didn’t say it. … I think it was the Harvard report,” he said.\n\nHe also stood by his assertion that the United States would reach that number someday, although he did not use the words “very soon.”\n\n“Somebody came out with a study of 5 million people,” Trump said. “Do I think we will? I think we will. … We are going to be there at a certain point. We’ll be there.”\n\nAt the same Oval Office meeting, Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, suggested the United States was still a way off from achieving 5 million tests per day."}

For more free stories, sign up for our daily Coronavirus Updates newsletter.\n\nJump to metric: Daily counts U.S. map State totals Testing\n\nThe disease caused by the novel coronavirus has killed at least people in the United States. The country’s earliest covid-19 fatality was thought to be a 58-year-old man near Seattle, whose death was announced Feb. 29.\n\nBut on April 22, officials in California announced that tissue from two people who had died in early and mid-February in Santa Clara County had tested positive, signaling that the virus may have spread in the country weeks earlier than was previously thought.\n\nDeaths Cases\n\nNew deaths reported per day A total of have been reported since Feb. 29. Show by All U.S. Loading data... Note: The spike in mid-April is due to New York City authorities adding probable cases to the city’s death tally.\n\nAs the death toll rose through March and April and U.S. testing lagged, criteria for reporting deaths changed in some states and cities. Even now, jurisdictions continue to fine-tune their counting and reporting procedures, so numbers in this piece may fluctuate as local authorities classify and reclassify cases.\n\nNew York City, for instance, in mid-April added to its total more than 3,700 deaths of people who were presumed to have covid-19 but were never tested.\n\nBy April 13, the virus had killed in every state.\n\nDeaths Cases Adjusted for population Raw numbers Deaths reported per 100,000 residents by county Use two fingers to pan around the map.\n\nPinch to zoom.

Double-tap to explore Click on a state to explore county details\n\n[Mapping the spread of the coronavirus worldwide]\n\nBecause testing was slow to begin in the United States, health officials agree that the number of reported cases is much lower than the actual number of people who have the disease, and even the count of deaths is probably low because of differences in reporting by overwhelmed local jurisdictions.\n\nHot spots have erupted in a few places with large outbreaks, none more dire than in New York, where at least cases have been reported and at least have died since March 14, when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) announced the death of an 82-year-old woman.\n\n[Has someone close to you died from covid-19? Share your story with The Washington Post.]\n\nAlthough it is a populous state, New York also leads the country in deaths per 100,000 residents. Neighboring states are not far behind.\n\nHard-hit Louisiana suffered an early breakout in New Orleans, which may have been fueled by the month-long Carnival celebration that drew more than a million people to the city in February and culminated in a raucous — and crowded — Mardi Gras.\n\nDeaths Cases Adjusted for population Raw numbers Deaths reported per 100,000 residents Loading data...\n\nDeaths Cases Adjusted for population Raw numbers\n\nState Confirmed cases per 100k Deaths per 100k New deaths since See all\n\nBut those are far from the only areas struggling to contain the disease and treat its victims.\n\nWashington, where the U.S. outbreak was first announced in early February, has had a high number of deaths among older people, particularly in the Seattle area. The disease took root early in several King County nursing homes and facilities that care for older, sicker people.\n\n[Tracking known coronavirus cases in D.C., Maryland and Virginia]\n\nMost deaths worldwide have occurred among people older than 50 and those with underlying health problems, as they are often most vulnerable to respiratory disease.\n\nWayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit, has a high rate of infections per capita thanks in part, health officials told the Detroit Free Press, to economic disparities. People in areas of concentrated poverty tend to have higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and obesity.\n\n[What you need to know about coronavirius]\n\nThe virus is not just an urban issue. Sparsely populated rural areas don’t have the huge raw numbers of cases or deaths that cities are reporting, but some rank highly in deaths and cases per capita. People in very rural areas are more likely to die of flu than urbanites and may be more vulnerable to covid-19 as well, according to a Post analysis of CDC data.\n\nDeaths Cases Adjusted for population Raw numbers\n\nTen counties with highest rate of deaths\n\nCounty Confirmed cases per 100k Deaths per 100k\n\nA handful of counties in southwestern Georgia have some of the highest rates of infection and deaths in the country. The governor sent Georgia National Guard troops to help with medical care in Dougherty County, which has fewer than 100,000 people but more than 1,000 cases and dozens of deaths.\n\nHowever, not all numbers are terrible. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) was the first to issue a statewide stay-at-home order on March 19 in an attempt to contain the spread of the disease that had already infiltrated the San Francisco Bay area and greater Los Angeles. Most governors eventually issued similar orders, and preliminary data show that the early social-distancing orders are working.\n\nAdjusted for population Raw numbers Tests reported per 100,000 residents Positive tests Negative tests Loading data... State Tests reported Tests per 100k See all\n\nOn April 16, as the virus appeared to be waning in some places and just arriving in others, the Trump administration released a framework for “reopening” the country.\n\nAccording to the president’s guidelines, accurate and thorough test results are necessary so officials can make informed decisions about easing stay-at-home restrictions.\n\nBecause there is no coordinated national testing system, and testing criteria and frequency vary widely among states and even among localities within states. Widespread implementation of testing has also experienced significant delays. As a result, some states and areas test much higher percentages of their populations than others, according to the Covid Tracking Project."}

In April, eBay’s top “pre-owned and in-demand” items included puzzles (No. 1), cardio equipment, golf training sets and Legos.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA number of online sites found that after a short period of uncertainty as stay-at-home restrictions began in March, interest in both buying and selling is growing.\n\nTamara Rosenthal, a vice president at Sotheby’s Home, the virtual consignment division of Sotheby’s auction house, says it’s a good time to divest items. “People are sitting at home staring at their walls and thinking about what they need.” So, if you have the emotional bandwidth and are healthy, Rosenthal says, “it’s a good time to start selling things.”\n\nYou can open your own online shop on sites such as eBay or Etsy or sell your things to a reseller. Sites such as Ruby Lane and Replacements sell china and collectibles. Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace are still options, though using them will require good social distancing practices, thorough cleaning and contactless curbside pickup.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Etsy, which has 2.7 million active sellers, you can create your own storefront with photos of what you want to sell. It costs 20 cents per item to list, and the site takes 5 percent of the sale price. “Right now is certainly a time for people to reevaluate, refresh and maybe start a new business,” says Dayna Isom Johnson, Etsy’s trend expert.\n\nSotheby’s Home consigns things that sell for about $150 and up. Experts will help you come up with a fair price; items can be on the site for up to a year. A Sotheby’s Home liaison can work with the seller through videoconferencing to advise on how to take the best photo angles and measurements of the items. The selling price is a 50/50 split. Rosenthal says items such as bowls, boxes and trays have been doing well. “Perhaps people are at home and feel the need to organize,” she says.\n\nBecoming a seller takes planning and strategy, says Lori Verderame (a.k.a. Dr. Lori), a Pennsylvania antiques appraiser who offers online video appraisals and appears on the History Channel’s treasure-hunting show “The Curse of Oak Island.” Know what you have and what it’s worth. “We are not in a typical market, and we aren’t living the way we normally do,” she says. Now might be a good time to sell smaller items under $250; it might be best to wait to sell larger pieces of furniture or expensive jewelry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe urges people to figure out logistics in advance. Will you use PayPal? Will you take personal checks? Will you pass on shipping costs to the buyer?\n\nAbove all, be realistic. If you’ve watched too many episodes of “Antiques Roadshow,” you can waste a lot of time trying to sell items at outrageous prices.\n\nWe’ve picked a few popular categories and asked experts for advice.\n\nCDs and DVDs\n\nYou won’t get rich selling off your music or movie collection, but doing so will free up space.\n\nDecluttr is one of the buyback sites specializing in tech and media. The average price it will pay you for a CD is 82 cents; for a DVD, it’s 78 cents. You download its app and scan bar codes, and Decluttr will give you a price and send a free shipping label, which you print out.\n\nAD\n\n“We are seeing more people get valuations,” says James Bell, Decluttr’s head of marketing. Tastes in music go in cycles. Right now, the Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Bon Jovi and Dolly Parton are still in demand; Justin Bieber and boybands, not so much, Bell says. If an icon such as Bill Withers dies, their CDs often sell out. Lots of people are trying to dump their “Frozen” DVDs, but not many want to buy them. But box sets are spiking, one being “Mad Men.”\n\nAD\n\nIf you plan to sell your CDs, original packaging and inserts are preferable, with undamaged jewel cases. Here’s another tip: When scanning, remove all stickers, and make sure you scan the bar code from the original CD or DVD sleeve.\n\nVintage clothes\n\nThe market for vintage clothing was fairly healthy before the pandemic, but it was also flooded with merchandise after so many people became Marie Kondo followers. Buying vintage clothes is a greener way to shop, but it’s also seasonal: Your 1980s light-up reindeer holiday sweater would probably sell better in December than now.\n\nAD\n\nAgain, you need to decide whether you just want to get rid of your unwanted clothes (by mailing them in a prepaid bag to places such as ThredUp — and getting cash or credit when the accepted items sell) or downloading an app such Poshmark or Mercari, posting your own photos and paying commission and other applicable fees.\n\nAD\n\nTerry Palmer from Colorado has an Etsy shop called Wear it Well, where she has been selling vintage clothes for 10 years. She sells pieces from many eras, which she finds thrifting or at estate sales. But the pandemic has sent her into her own closet for new pieces. She says the 1990s style is in demand right now: turtlenecks, long boyfriend cardigans, blouses with bold floral patterns and shoes from Anne Klein and Nine West. “It’s difficult to sell dresses right now with this at-home lifestyle,” she says.\n\nVerderame says she has seen concert T-shirts, designer labels and sneakers in demand. Johnson says Etsy sellers have seen interest in 1990s crop tops, tie-dye and vintage handbags. Her tips for listing include being very specific about measurements and details. People love stories, so if you wore the gown to your 1976 prom or bought the shoes on a trip to Capri, Italy, include that.\n\nAD\n\nVintage housewares\n\nAs isolated citizens get reacquainted with their homes, they are going to be thinking about things they might want to make their spaces more attractive or functional.\n\nAD\n\nSo if you have home accessories you want to get rid of, it might be good time to offload them. Champagne glasses, nightstands and vintage garden accessories are moving these days, says Pixie Windsor, owner of Washington’s Miss Pixie’s Furnishings and Whatnot. She can’t go to estate sales and flea markets, so she’s digging merchandise out of her storerooms and closets and sharing finds on Instagram now that her bricks-and-mortar shop on 14th Street is closed. (She has started offering curbside pickup.) Johnson says there have been spikes in interest in 1970s homewares, items with bee motifs and porcelain horses.\n\nAD\n\nPatrick Newell of JPN Antiquities in Warrenton, Va., has been in the antiques business for 25 years and started an Etsy shop three years ago. Since he had to close his bricks-and-mortar shop due to the coronavirus, he has been posting more wares on Instagram. He says collecting whimsical paintings and figurines of animals is still a thing: foxes, frogs, cats, dogs, pigs and cows. Blue-and-white china is always a classic seller. Right now, he’s selling his collection of old Virginia, Maryland and D.C. history and architecture books (mostly $30 to $35 each) right off the overflowing shelves in his home, much to the delight of his wife.\n\nToys\n\nIt’s a good time to get rid of unwanted puzzles, for sure, though that’s not going to cover your weekly grocery tab. But if you have rare Star Wars collectibles in original packaging, you might be able to retire. Sites such as neatstuffcollectibles.com list the comic books, movie memorabilia and sports items they are interested in selling.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith people stuck inside with their kids, Lego sets are in demand. Some sites buy Legos by the pound. Decluttr instructs customers to put bricks into a plastic bag and weigh it, and the company will give a price, usually about $1 per pound.\n\nAlthough some people will tell you Beanie Babies are a lost cause, Joanna Haber says her Etsy shop, Beanie Babies by Whimsy, is doing okay. Haber is selling off her collection of about 200 of the plush little animals that were a hot collectible in the 1990s. Although most originally sold for $5 to $8, Haber prices most of hers at about $40 — except for her $50,000 “Scorch” purple plush dragon, which draws lookers into her shop. (He has a rare manufacturing defect, she says.) Her advice: If you want to sell Beanies, they should be in mint condition with both hang tag and tush tag, the manufacturer’s fabric tag attached to the Beanie’s bottom. “Don’t list something that your dog got a hold of 20 years ago,” she advises. And it helps to write a nice story about the Beanie’s life.\n\nSilver\n\nMany of us have thought about dumping the family silver. It’s hard to know what is the right moment.\n\nAD\n\nBut do you even know whether you have sterling silver or silverplate? Many people don’t, says Beth Walker, co-founder of Gryphon Estate Silver in North Carolina, who buys and sells silver online. And it makes all the difference for what your candlesticks are worth. Check for the word “sterling” on your piece; the majority of U.S. silver will be stamped that. For other silver markings, check out 925-1000.com to learn more about hallmarks and identification, she says.\n\nA plated flatware set for eight or 12 would go for about $75 to $200, she says. A sterling flatware set, depending on pattern, condition, engraving and number of pieces, could bring in $1,000 to $1,800 or more at retail. Tiffany is the most desired of makers, she says, but other popular ones include Reed & Barton, Kirk and Gorham.\n\nSilver-plated items, unless you are into the shabby-chic look, are not much in demand right now, and they are usually better off donated to a thrift shop — when they reopen.\n\nNewell says he found that the market for even beautiful antique silver pieces was not great before the pandemic, and he fears there won’t be many people searching for silver services in the age of social isolation.\n\n“It’s going to be hard to turn most sterling silver into cash unless you melt it down,” he says. “If you are needing to supplement your income or get quick cash to pay the rent, forget it.”"}

Many have contracted and even died from Covid-19.\n\nBut the recent suicide of Dr. Lorna Breen , a New York City emergency room doctor who recovered from Covid-19, has highlighted the risks health care workers face to their emotional and psychological health, too.\n\n\"Even outside of the pandemic, you're talking about a vulnerable population of people,\" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. \"You know, there's a lot of stress.\"\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created what's known as \"second victims,\" according to Curtis Reisinger, a clinical psychologist and the director of the Employee Assistance Program at Northwell Health in New York. The term refers to health care providers who experience trauma related to a patient's care.\n\nFor instance, Reisinger said he has heard from health care workers who say that Covid-19 has kept them from being able to fully care for their patients' needs.\n\n\"The pain they are experiencing is sometimes wanting to get closer and wanting to help, but you can't,\" he said.\n\nBecause coronavirus is so contagious, families are not allowed in hospitals and health care workers can't get too close to infected patients, leaving patients alone\n\n\"You can see the fear in somebody's eyes, (but) you can't give them a hug, you can't reassure them,\" he said. \"They're suffering watching what they can't do.\"\n\nSuicide of Dr. Breen\n\nJUST WATCHED Father of late ER doctor says she 'just ran out of steam' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Father of late ER doctor says she 'just ran out of steam' 03:27\n\nThe pandemic's effect on mental health is most immediately evident in the death of Breen, who contracted coronavirus while working in the hospital during the pandemic, according to her father, Dr. Philip Breen . She returned to work after a week, which he said in hindsight was not enough time.\n\n\"I think she felt an overwhelming sense of wanting to help her colleagues and her friends who were still fighting the good fight, and so she strapped on her harness and took the bit in her mouth and she went back,\" he said.\n\nWhen she returned to work, she couldn't last through a 12-hour shift, her father said. Her friends and relatives helped her get to her family in Charlottesville, Virginia, and there she was admitted to the hospital at the University of Virginia for exhaustion, her father said.\n\nAfter about a week, Lorna Breen left the hospital to stay with her mom, he said. Then, last weekend, she went to stay with her sister, and she died by suicide on Sunday morning.\n\n\"As of Sunday, she took her own life because I think she was tired and she was the kind of person, as somebody has very aptly put it, she was like the fireman who runs into the burning building to save another life and doesn't regard anything about herself. So she has paid the price and she's been in the trenches,\" her father said.\n\nIn the wake of Breen's death, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and first lady Chirlane McCray announced a collaboration between the US Department of Defense, NYC Health + Hospitals, and Greater New York Hospital Association to provide mental health programs for frontline health care workers and first responders.\n\n\"Our frontline heroes are fighting a war on two fronts,\" de Blasio said in a statement. \"They have been through so much to protect their fellow New Yorkers, and we will not allow them to shoulder the mental toll of this pandemic alone. To those who are struggling: your city hears you, we see you, and help is on the way.\"\n\nAmong all Americans, the suicide rate has increased 35% from 1999 to 2018, according to a data brief released by the National Center for Health Statistics\n\nIn addition, a CDC analysis , based on data from 17 states that participated in the 2012 and 2015 National Violent Death Reporting System, looked at US suicides by occupational group . The analysis found that, among all occupations, health care practitioners and technical occupations had the sixth-highest suicide rate among women and the eighth-highest rate among men in 2015.\n\n'Constant state of paranoia'\n\nThe risks to their own health, high stress life-and-death situations and long hours in a demanding job make health care a particularly toiling field even in normal times.\n\nBut Gupta said the novel coronavirus pandemic has amplified those issues to another level because it is new and unprecedented.\n\n\"A lot of times, as challenging as the roles can be, for EMTs in particular and the ER doctors, there is still a pattern to things. Like how you get things done, how you work your way through problems,\" Gupta said. \"When you're dealing with things that are completely new, unfamiliar, that can be really challenging.\"\n\nIn addition, health care workers risk spreading the virus to loved ones. Some have chosen to temporarily separate from their families to avoid spreading the illness . Shortages in personal protective equipment, or PPE, have exacerbated those fears, Gupta said.\n\nLast month, at Elmhurst Hospital in New York, health care workers were living in a \"constant state of paranoia,\" one person who identified as a nurse there but did not want to be named told CNN at the time.\n\n\"We don't know if we even have the virus,\" the person said, \"and we're so scared to give it to someone else.\"\n\nIn a social media post last month, one nurse at a large Long Island hospital in New York shared her feelings on social media, saying, \"I haven't slept because my mind won't shut off.\"\n\nThe nurse, who said she works in a Covid-19 triage area, said the previous night was \"so far the worst I have seen.\"\n\nPatients were streaming in nonstop, she said, coughing and sweating, with fevers and \"fear in their eyes.\" The nurse wrote that she cried in the bathroom during her break, peeling off the PPE that left indentations in her face.\n\n\"I cry for my co workers, because we know it will get worse and I already feel like that is impossible and we are already at our breaking point,\" she said. \"I cry for the parents, children, siblings, spouses who cannot be with their loved ones who may be dying but can't have visitors because there is no visiting allowed.\"\n\nDr. Shahdabul Faraz, a resident physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, wrote for CNN about how Covid-19 hospital policies have led to isolation.\n\n\"These policies serve an important purpose, but it also means that providers lack adequate peer support. We no longer spend as much time with our colleagues. People have stopped eating together. There are no more meetings or collective coffee breaks,\" he wrote.\n\n\"To make matters worse, many of us cannot even find solace in our own homes. Some providers have taken refuge in their basements or garages or have completely moved out in the hopes of safeguarding their family members from the virus.\""}

Several states, including Iowa and Texas, are warning residents who are called back that they may be cut off from unemployment benefits -- including the $600 bump authorized by Congress in March -- if they refuse to return.\n\nUncertainty about continued access to benefits comes after 26 million Americans filed for first-time jobless claims in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic prompted many governors to order non-essential businesses to shutter. Millions are still struggling to apply or waiting for their payments to begin after the surge of filers overwhelmed state unemployment agencies.\n\nWhether or not people have to give up their unemployment benefits if they opt not to go back to work depends on several factors, including the state they live in and their personal situation.\n\nGeneral concern about exposure to coronavirus is typically not a sufficient enough reason to stay home and continue collecting benefits, according to a recent guidance from the US Department of Labor.\n\nHowever, some people could remain eligible for unemployment under a special pandemic program Congress created that allows those who were advised by a health provider to self-quarantine or who are caring for children whose schools have closed, for example, to qualify for benefits.\n\nStill, states may interpret the guideline somewhat differently, experts said.\n\nGeorgia urges businesses to develop plans with workers\n\nTake Georgia, among the first states to reopen certain establishments , including hair salons, gyms and bowling alleys, with certain caveats, such as social distancing and screening employees for illness.\n\nThe state is urging businesses to work with their employees to develop plans to return. To encourage residents, it boosted the maximum amount workers can earn before they start losing their jobless benefits to $300 a week, up from $55.\n\nSome people will likely be able to remain on the pandemic unemployment assistance program, but they should still speak with their employers to see whether there's a way for them to safely return, said Kersha Cartwright, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Labor.\n\n\"Everybody needs to go back to work eventually,\" said Cartwright, noting continuing eligibility will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nRepublican Gov. Brian Kemp's decision to reopen the state has left Cameren Cook in a bind. She lost her job as a line cook at an Atlanta restaurant in mid-March and has been receiving unemployment benefits for several weeks. Her employer told her it may restart dine-in service next week, but she doesn't feel she could maintain enough of a distance from other workers in the kitchen.\n\nThe Decatur, Georgia, resident not only fears she could get sick, but she doesn't want to risk bringing the virus home to her roommates, one of whom is asthmatic. Even though she expects she would only return part-time at first, which would allow her to collect a small paycheck and keep her unemployment benefits, Cook does not want to go back yet.\n\n\"A stack of money is not going to keep me safe from coronavirus,\" said Cook, 34.\n\nSelf-employed and gig workers have new protections\n\nThe pandemic program, which also allows the self-employed, independent contractors and gig workers to qualify for unemployment, may save Ysheka Mitchell from having to return to work immediately as a hair stylist and make up artist.\n\nMitchell opted to stop working in mid-March, even before Kemp's stay-at-home order, because she lives with her parents and her father has a serious lung condition. The South Fulton, Georgia, resident is still waiting to be approved for unemployment benefits but said she will not return to the hair salon where she works for now, even though it has reopened.\n\nThe hair salon where Ysheka Mitchell works has reopened, but she doesn't plan to return immediately because she lives with her father, who is ill.\n\n\"I don't want to expose him to anything that could be deadly,\" said Mitchell, 40, who is self-employed.\n\nSafety requirements must be met\n\nBusinesses that reopen typically have to follow certain safety standards mandated by state officials. If they don't, workers may be able to quit and qualify for benefits after documenting the lapses and speaking to their employer, said Anne Carder, managing attorney at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society.\n\nOther states, however, are stressing that some workers may not have to return to their jobs right away.\n\nColorado, for instance, this week started allowing some businesses to reopen. But \"vulnerable individuals,\" including senior citizens or those with certain health conditions, cannot be compelled to return if they have to work near others, the state Department of Labor and Employment said. Also, the agency specifies that the vulnerable may continue to be eligible for benefits if returning to work is a risk to their health or the health of someone they live with.\n\nResidents who don't want to return to work need to specify the reasons why when they recertify for unemployment benefits.\n\n\"If you've been offered a job and refused that job for health reasons or Covid reasons, be sure and put that into the form so that we can look at that, assess that and determine if you may be eligible to continue to receive benefits,\" said Joe Barela, the department's executive director."}

Analysts on average were expecting $2.38 billion in revenues on earnings per share of $0.72. Ebay itself was expecting sales of between $2.55 billion and $2.60 billion, with GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $0.50 – $0.53 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $0.70 – $0.73. In other words, eBay missed on sales in terms of analyst average projections, beat their expectations on EPS, and beat both of its own internal targets.\n\nAt the time of writing, eBay’s stock was down 7 cents in after-hours trading.\n\n“During these unprecedented times, I am extremely proud of how our team has come together to support one another, our buyers and sellers, our communities and the business,” said Scott Schenkel, eBay’s interim CEO, in the earnings statement. “As we look at Q1, I am pleased that we delivered on all of our commitments for the quarter, with key metrics such as Buyers, GMV and Revenue performing at or better than our expectations. Over the past several months, we have remained focused and clear-eyed about the strategic direction of the company and have driven substantial changes to position the business for sustainable and profitable long-term growth.”\n\n“I appreciate the team’s hard work in the first quarter and their efforts to maintain focus amid so many factors affecting the business and the industry,” said Jamie Iannone, the new permanent CEO that it headhunted from Walmart, in a separate statement. “I’m thrilled to return to eBay this week as CEO and I look forward to building on the positive momentum in the business, continuing to evolve the Company’s strategy and maximizing value for our shareholders.”\n\nAs expected, the company — like other e-commerce giants — has seen a boost in buyer demand from the throngs of consumers who are currently being ordered to stay at home, but who still need to buy things, and specifically try to source items that they’re finding a challenge to find in more local stores. eBay noted that active buyers are up by 2% and now total 174 million global active buyers.\n\nDespite that, however, gross merchandise volume (GMV, or total sales volume before any cuts are taken) was $21.3 billion, down 1% on an as-reported basis. We might assume that the decline might have been significantly steeper without the current climate, or that it has at least offset other kinds of declines.\n\nWithin that, its Marketplace generated $2.1 billion of revenue, down 1%, while Classifieds saw $248 million of revenue, down 3%. That Classifieds business is on the block as part of the company’s wider efforts to restructure. “eBay continues to explore potential value-creating alternatives for its Classifieds business, is holding active discussions with multiple parties, and anticipates having an update by the middle of the year,” the company noted.\n\nThere is a cloud hanging over many e-commerce businesses, even those that are seeing strong demand. The reason for this is that the economy is very shaky right now, and we don’t fully know what the coming months will hold, in terms of public health, government rules on how we can move, whether we will have jobs and money to spend. And all of that is playing into how companies like eBay will perform under its new CEO and continuing pressure from its activist investors.\n\nWith all that in mind, Ebay also updated its guidance for the next quarter and reiterated figures for the full year. Q2, it expects, will have revenues of between $2.38 billion and $2.48 billion, with GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $0.50 – $0.57 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $0.73 – $0.80.\n\nThe full-year figures are unchanged at between $9.56 billion and $9.76 billion, with GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $2.20 – $2.30 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the range of $3.00 – $3.10.\n\n“Given the dynamic environment, we are not revising our full year revenue and EPS estimates,” the company notes. “This guidance reflects management’s expectations for operational performance and the impacts seen in both of our Marketplaces and Classifieds platforms to date, but given the uncertainty surrounding the extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to predict what may result as shelter-in-place guidelines are eased and lifted and how global consumer demand, the effects of COVID-19 on the general economy, seller inventory and advertising spending may evolve over time.”\n\nMore to come."}

Their share prices are holding up or even surging ahead as investors bet they will come out of the crisis even stronger.\n\nBut Covid-19 has also shone a spotlight on two tech tycoons with radically different attitudes to the battle to control the virus: Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe contrast was seen in the way the two men treated what is usually the sober, perhaps even somnolent, environment of an analysts' conference call after their latest financial results.\n\nFor the last few weeks, Tesla's mercurial founder has been tweeting in increasingly intemperate fashion.\n\nFirst he expressed scepticism about the threat from the coronavirus. Then he condemned what he saw as the excessive measures to combat it.\n\nThe lockdown in California has meant the closure of his main production plant in Fremont, and Mr Musk wants it open again.\n\n\"Bravo Texas!,\" he tweeted yesterday, linking to a report about the state easing restrictions.\n\nThen came a big statement in capital letters: FREE AMERICA NOW.\n\nBut it was during the analysts' call, following results delivering a surprise profit during the first quarter, that his anger boiled over.\n\nIn his opening statement Musk did not mention the virus. But in response to questions, he railed against California's order to residents to stay at home:\n\n\"To say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom.\"\n\nHis language became even more extreme at one point.\n\nHe said an extension of the shelter-in-place policy was \"forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights\".\n\nHe added: \"Breaking people's freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong is not why people came to America or built this country.\"\n\nHe then used a strong expletive - one which it is safe to say I have never heard on a public conference call - before continuing: \"Excuse me. But outrage - it's an outrage.\"\n\nThere was a fair bit of outrage in response. Not from the analysts who continued asking about gross margin and the rollout of an app, but from onlookers on Twitter.\n\nSome pointed out that the Tesla tycoon has proved far from prescient in his analysis of the threat from the virus.\n\nOn 19 March, he remarked that there had been no new cases in China and added: \"Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April.\"\n\nSo far, there have been over more than one million coronavirus cases in the United States and about 60,000 deaths.\n\nOpposing view\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook's founder was talking about his company's latest results, which saw a fall in profits but still managed to please investors despite a warning that the business was \"facing a period of unprecedented uncertainty\".\n\nMark Zuckerberg's language on his conference call with analysts was not as colourful as that of Elon Musk.\n\nBut he was pretty frank in advancing an opposing view to the Tesla tycoon. A rush to return to normality was a really bad idea for both public health and the economy, he said.\n\n\"While there are massive societal costs from the current shelter-in-place restrictions, I worry that reopening certain places too quickly before infection rates have been reduced to very minimal levels will almost guarantee future outbreaks and worsen longer-term health and economic outcomes.\"\n\nNow you could say it is easier for Mark Zuckerberg to take this stance - his employees can do a pretty good job of keeping Facebook ticking over from home, while Tesla staff won't be building any cars in their backyards.\n\nWhile the social media firm may be concerned about a fall in advertising, it is far better placed than old media businesses to weather the downturn. Its share price, which is only modestly down since February, reflects that.\n\nMind you, Tesla shares continue to defy gravity. You might think that with its main factory closed, a low oil price making electric cars look less desirable and a chief executive apparently incapable of self-control, investors would be heading for the hills.\n\nBut no, the shares were already back up near an all-time peak and are set to climb higher after the latest results.\n\nTesla, which sold 367,500 cars in 2019, is now valued by the market at close on $150bn (£120bn). That's nearly four times as much as the giant US manufacturer GM, which sold about 7.7 million cars last year.\n\nAll this means that Elon Musk could be about to enjoy a bumper pay-out. He looks on track to hit the targets set by his board for boosting the value of the company, which would trigger the opportunity for him to make a profit of around $740m on stock options.\n\nYou might have thought that Silicon Valley hubris and Wall Street hysteria about tech stocks were two things that had gone right out of fashion in the last couple of months. Try telling that to Elon Musk."}

The true number may never be known, but families are asking why so many of their elderly relatives were lost.\n\nAround lunchtime on 8 March, Rosana Castillo met up with some close friends not far from her house in Lucero, a working-class neighbourhood in west Madrid, and, as they did every year, joined a protest to mark International Women's Day. They gave each other a warm hug, held hands and marched to chants of \"Down with the patriarchy\" and \"Feminism will win\".\n\nSpaniards, then, could still venture freely outside and coronavirus, which had already killed several hundred in Italy, felt more like someone else's pain. Castillo, a 60-year-old retired primary school co-ordinator, had seen a few people on the underground wearing surgical masks as a protection, but thought most of them were probably tourists. \"We weren't really talking about it here,\" she said.\n\nBut it was preying on her mind. She had visited Carmela, her 86-year-old mother, hours before at Monte Hermoso, the care home near the square where the women had gathered. Arriving at the main gate, Castillo was told she could not come in. A worker said two residents had contracted Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, and visits had been suspended.\n\nCastillo had seen Carmela, who had advanced Alzheimer's, three days earlier, when her mother was discharged from hospital after a week's treatment for breathing difficulties. The doctor told her Carmela was going to be fine, that her case was not related to the virus even though she had not been tested.\n\nTo Castillo's frustration, the worker said nothing else and went back inside Monte Hermoso. As she exchanged phone numbers with some relatives, Castillo saw another worker rushing away, covering her mouth with a piece of cloth. They had known each other for a long time but the woman did not stop to talk, Castillo became suspicious. \"At that moment,\" she told me, \"I felt something wasn't right.\"\n\nIt was already widely known, first from China, then Italy, that elderly people with existing health issues were especially vulnerable to the virus. Yet in Spain, where a fifth of the population is above 65, or some 8.9 million people, the government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez had done little in response.\n\nAs Castillo followed news of the outbreak, she wondered if enough was being done to protect her mother or, indeed, anyone else. Unable to visit Carmela, who had lived there for five years, her only source of information came from infrequent, and usually very brief, phone calls from Monte Hermoso. No matter how much Castillo asked, few things were said.\n\nConsuelo Domínguez, a long-time friend, coincidentally, also had her mother living in Monte Hermoso, a red-brick, private centre with large windows and rooms for up to 130 residents. She, too, struggled to get details. Both daughters knew some staff had gone into isolation with coughs and a fever, the most common symptoms of Covid-19, and were pretty sure there was more going on.\n\nCoronavirus was spreading in Spain at an alarming speed and, on 14 March, the prime minister imposed a state of emergency with a nationwide stay-at-home order. No-one was truly safe. On that afternoon, Domínguez received an unexpected call from Monte Hermoso. The worker was \"very tense,\" she said, \"you could feel it.\" Surreptitiously, Domínguez was told that 70 people had been infected with the virus and at least 10 patients had already died. \"I was frightened,\" she said. Domínguez called her friend. \"I couldn't believe it,\" Castillo recalled. \"We weren't being told the truth.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption After the deaths, the Madrid government announced it would intervene in Monte Hermoso\n\nCastillo and Domínguez alerted journalists and, on 17 March, Monte Hermoso became national news. Only then did the Madrid government reportedly become aware of the devastating outbreak. Nineteen people were already dead.\n\nIt had been a stressful day. In the evening, Castillo received a call from Monte Hermoso. Her mother, who shared her room with another woman in similarly poor health, had a fever. \"It shocked me,\" Castillo said. She knew Carmela was unlikely to survive.\n\nThe relatives created a WhatsApp group, and disturbing messages flowed in. \"Staff were very nervous... Some [residents] were even a little bit delirious,\" said one of a visit two days before they had been halted. Aurora Santos, whose mother was also at Monte Hermoso, recalled seeing residents unwell in the cafeteria around the same time. \"We didn't know anything the management had done,\" she told me, \"the protocols they had followed, nothing\".\n\nShe joined Castillo and Domínguez in gathering information. They believed patients with symptoms had not been separated from those without, before the virus spread rapidly through the home. Staff who had been in isolation after falling ill were reportedly not being replaced, while those who continued to work were having to do longer, exhausting shifts. Lacking adequate protection, workers had to make face masks at home. \"We were trying to help, our loved ones were there,\" Domínguez said. \"Why weren't they being honest with us?\"\n\nMonte Hermoso, it turned out, was not alone. In fact, nobody seemed to know the true scale of what was going on. For years, Carmen Flores, head of the Patients' Defenders ombudsman group, had warned about precarious conditions in some of Spain's 5,417 care homes. \"The amount of messages we were getting those days was insane,\" Flores told me. \"I was thinking: You can't let these people rot.\"\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption \"We weren't being told the truth,\" said Rosana Castillo, whose 86-year-old mother lived in Monte Hermoso\n\nThree in every four homes in Spain are privately run and many patients, like Carmela, have some of their costs publicly funded. José Manuel Ramírez, president of the federation representing social care managers, said fees received by the residences had not changed in the past decade, a result of years of austerity in Spain.\n\nMany companies had to carry out savings somewhere to make a profit, claimed Flores, who also alleged that some lacked equipment even in normal times, while many operated with minimum staff. Workers' unions also say staffing was insufficient, which Ramírez rejected. A worker at one care home where more than 90 patients died told me: \"For a long time we had been saying something serious would happen. The conditions were unsustainable. This isn't a surprise at all.\"\n\nCrowded hospitals were having to turn away patients from care homes and send them back, often to die. Many residences did not have oxygen bottles, crucial in treating a disease known to cause severe respiratory problems, or even a doctor. Monte Hermoso, Castillo said, had one doctor, who most days worked only in the mornings.\n\nThe Spanish government had centralised the purchase and distribution of medical material, so the homes asked officials to send tests and protective kits. However, Ramírez alleged they were not given priority, and pictures emerged of carers wearing gowns made of plastic bags. \"There was nothing that could be done without support,\" he said. \"It was a catastrophe.\"\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption The army was sent to disinfect residences across Spain and Monte Hermoso was one of the first\n\nThe army was deployed to disinfect 1,300 care homes and Monte Hermoso was one of the first. Margarita Robles, the defence minister, said patients, in some places, were found abandoned without care, sometimes dead in their beds, the bodies left for funeral services to retrieve. \"Un horror,\" Flores told me.\n\nAlmost 6,000 people have now died in nursing homes in Madrid, after showing Covid-19 symptoms. Public prosecutors are investigating possible crimes including manslaughter for neglect, mistreatment and abandonment.\n\n\"I think there was a lot of wrongdoing,\" said Castillo. \"These people couldn't shout or say they were unwell. They died in silence and alone.\" Monte Hermoso has not replied to interview requests by email; when contacted by phone, an employee told me they would not talk to journalists.\n\nAt six in the morning on 22 March, Rosana Castillo got the final call from Monte Hermoso. Carmela had died. Her body was to be cremated, and there would be no chance to say a final goodbye. At home with her husband and son, Castillo paid tribute the only way she could. \"I thought of her with love, and hoped it was as painless as possible.\" Her mother's roommate, Castillo learned later, had died a week before.\n\nAlberto Reyero, councillor for social policies of the Madrid authority, said the homes were not \"sufficiently prepared\" for a crisis of the magnitude brought by the pandemic. At least 48 deaths have been linked to coronavirus at Monte Hermoso, one of 14 facilities where the regional government intervened earlier this month. All 65 residents who remained there had shown symptoms while six were in hospital. Reyero said: \"We all made mistakes.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Inside the ICU in one of Spain's biggest hospitals\n\nThe task of counting the dead continues in Spain, where the official toll has passed 24,000. It remains unclear how many of the deaths in nursing homes have been included in that total. As many people were cremated or buried without being tested, like Carmela, the disease's true numbers may never be known.\n\nThe Women's Day marches of 8 March are now seen as a symbol of the initial inaction of Spanish authorities. So too was a packed La Liga football match between Real Betis and Real Madrid in Seville and a rally, also in Madrid, staged by the far-right party, Vox.\n\nFinally, though, the worst seems to be over. After pressure from the families, Domínguez and Santos began receiving more frequent calls from Monte Hermoso and, on some days, they could see their mothers via video. \"We want to know what happened,\" Santos said, \"to give some meaning to the deaths.\"\n\nIt was 15 days after her mother's death that Castillo received her ashes and that was when reality hit. \"Before, it felt like a dream,\" she told me, \"I thought I could wake up and be with her.\" She plans to drive the family to Meco, her mother's native village outside Madrid, and bury her ashes next to where her father has been laid to rest.\n\nFind out more"}

The family migrated to India after the partition in 1947.\n\nIn 1990, Rishi Kapoor visited a residential building in Peshawar called Kapoor Haveli where his grandfather, Prithviraj and his father Raj Kapoor, were born.\n\nThe news he had lost his battle with cancer came a day after the death of Bollywood actor Irrfan Khan.\n\nKapoor was diagnosed with leukemia in 2018 and returned to India last September after a year-long course of treatment in New York.\n\nHe was taken to hospital on Wednesday morning after he complained of breathing difficulties, his brother Randhir Kapoor told the Press Trust of India.\n\nThe actor's family confirmed his death in a message saying his life had ended peacefully.\n\n\"The doctors and medical staff at the hospital said he kept them entertained to the last. He remained jovial and determined to live to the fullest right through two years of treatment across two continents. Family, friends, food and films remained his focus and everyone who met him during this time was amazed at how he did not let his illness get the better of him.\n\n\"He was grateful for the love of his fans that poured in from the world over.

A wonderful actor, with a huge fan following across generations, he will be greatly missed.\"\n\nNews of his death has also seen an outpouring of sadness on social media in Pakistan.\n\nFormer fast bowler Waqar Younis was among those who tweeted their condolences.\n\nThere was particular sadness in the city of Peshawar, where the Kapoor family used to live before the Partition of British India in 1947.\n\nCandles were lit there for Rishi's uncle Shashi Kapoor, another Bollywood star, when he died in 2017. Such a tribute for Rishi Kapoor may not happen, owing to Covid-19 restrictions.\n\n\"But Peshawar will dearly miss Rishi,\" the city's Cultural Heritage Council secretary Shakil Waheedullah told the BBC.\n\nHe was received at the actor's residence in 2009 on the first of two trips he made to Mumbai.\n\n\"He really made me feel at home.\"\n\nKapoor was prolific on social media, frequently commenting on controversial issues.\n\nHis last tweet was an appeal to people not to attack medical staff at the frontlines of the fight against the coronavirus saying, \"we have to win this war together\"."}

In addition:\n\nPlayers must arrive at training grounds in kit and wear masks at all times.\n\nThey must not shower or eat on the premises. If clubs want to provide players with food, it must be delivered as a takeaway to players' cars.\n\nOnly essential medical treatment would be allowed, with all medical staff in full PPE.\n\nAll meetings and reviews must take place virtually and off-site.\n\n'Farcical' face mask proposals\n\nBrighton striker Glenn Murray says some proposed protocols around the Premier League's return to action, such as wearing face masks, are \"farcical\".\n\n\"Face masks is going to be off-putting; it is not going to be natural. People will be ripping them off in games,\" the 36-year-old said. \"It is quite farcical.\n\n\"I understand why people are desperate to get football on. It has to be done in a sensible way and in the right time and in a way that is going to keep everyone safe.\n\n\"There will be ambulances at training and games. Is it fair to take those from the NHS? I don’t know.\n\n\"It is not just two squads, there is a lot more involved and it puts more people at risk.\"\n\nArsenal, Brighton and West Ham have opened their training grounds to players for individual work.\n\n\"I understand the public is desperate to get football back,\" said Murray. \"But it is us that are going to be going out there and competing against other teams.\n\n\"We are not talking about guys in one community.

Health, as the government has always said, must be everyone's priority.\n\n\"In these difficult times, I hope that this trophy will bring a little happiness and hope to all our supporters, and I am grateful to them for their unwavering support which helps drive Paris St-Germain forward.\"\n\nBefore the government's intervention, French football's governing body had been hoping to resume the season on 17 June.\n\nPSG have been awarded the title on a points-per-game basis, while Lorient have been crowned Ligue 2 champions on the same principle.\n\nThey were just one point above Lens when the season was suspended and both teams will be promoted.\n\nAmiens and Toulouse will be relegated from Ligue 1.\n\nLyon - who were fifth a week before the last match day, but finished seventh - said they might appeal against the verdict.\n\nNow set to miss out on a place in Europe next season, Lyon say they also \"reserve the right to claim damages\", which the club say amount to \"several tens of millions of euros\".\n\n\"There might be appeals but our decisions are solid,\" said Didier Quillot, the chief executive of the French League (LFP).\n\nQuillot added the LFP had until 25 May to tell Uefa which clubs will be qualified for European competitions.\n\nThat is the same day by which European leagues have to tell European football's governing body whether they want to complete or cancel their seasons.\n\nThe Dutch top flight was abandoned on Friday with no promotion or relegation and no champions, while on Monday Belgian clubs postponed a vote on confirming the cancellation of their top flight until next week.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBBC World Service reporter John Bennett\n\nThe French football authorities had three main options when it came to deciding the final league positions. They did not go for freezing the table after 27 games or freezing the table when everyone had played each other once, and instead they chose the points per game system.\n\nThe big losers from that decision are Lyon, who were in the Europa League places after match day 27, but under these rules finish in seventh place.\n\nIt means their only hope of getting into Europe next season is either winning the League Cup final, which could still be played later in the year but will probably be cancelled, or winning the Champions League, which is unlikely even if Uefa manage to somehow complete the matches.\n\nMeanwhile, PSG's dominance made the decision to crown champions a lot easier in France than it was in the Netherlands, where Ajax and AZ Alkmaar were level on points at the top and the KNVB decided there would be no title winners.\n\nSo a reason to celebrate for PSG but of course their main aim this season was to win the Champions League and remember, as unlikely as it would seem, they are still hoping they can complete that mission, saying that they would be prepared to play their matches abroad in August if it is not possible to play in France.\n\nFrench clubs now have to count the cost of losing crucial TV revenue in this shortened season and there will be some difficult decisions to be made for many of them."}

Americans had $2.17 trillion in savings last month.\n\nConsumers are putting more money away at a time when bank savings, money market accounts and Treasury bonds are yielding next to nothing after the Federal Reserve slashed rates to zero last month and launched numerous lending programs in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAt a press conference on Wednesday , Fed chair Jerome Powell was asked about what savers should do since rates are at zero. He conceded that for people \"really just relying on their bank savings account earnings, you're not going to benefit from low interest rates.\"\n\n\"But we have to look out for the overall economy. Low interest rates support employment, they support economic activity. And those are our mandates,\" he added.\n\nThe lack of interest income isn't deterring people from saving more even though many Americans are getting smaller paychecks.\n\nThe government also said Thursday that personal income fell 2% in March \"due to the response to the spread of COVID-19, as governments issued 'stay-at-home' orders.\" This was led by a staggering $327.6 billion drop in workers' salaries and bonuses.\n\nAnother 3.8 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the total to 30 million since mid-March. This is the worst contraction in the US economy since the Great Recession of 2008.\n\nIncomes are down -- but so is spending\n\nStill, consumers may be saving more because they are spending less -- a lot less, in fact.\n\nThe BEA also said Thursday that consumption expenditures fell 7.5% last month, led by a nearly $935 billion drop in spending on goods and services. Much of that is probably due to the widespread closure of businesses.\n\nJUST WATCHED US GDP shrank 4.8% in first quarter Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH US GDP shrank 4.8% in first quarter 02:44\n\nAmericans spent less on non-essential medical care, leisure and recreation and autos. The one notable area where spending went up? Food and beverages consumed at home.\n\nThe savings rate briefly soared to a peak of 12% in December 2012 at the height of the fiscal cliff crisis -- when federal tax cuts were set to expire and automatic government spending cuts were due to kick in. But it then plunged back to 5.8% in early 2013 after a budget deal was reached.\n\nSince then, the savings rate has slowly but surely crept back up. One economist theorized that perhaps Americans were preparing for an inevitable downturn.\n\n\"The savings rate had risen dramatically in the last couple years already,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in a tweet\n\n\"Speculation is people were bracing for the next recession. I don't look for silver linings, but the more people bank, the better the recovery,\" he added."}

The federal government rose to the challenge, and this is a great success story.\"\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nWhich, part, exactly is the \"great success story?\" President Donald Trump's repeated downplaying of the threat posed to America by the virus even as it was ravaging China? The badly sputtering start to necessary testing for the virus in the United States? The 30 million people unemployed ? The relentless promotion by the President of an anti-malarial drug that has not, in clinical trials, actually proven effective in fighting coronavirus? The more than 1 million people sickened and 60,000+ people dead because of coronavirus in the US?\n\nYou get the point.\n\nWhen 60,000 Americans are dead -- with projections that the death toll will rise another 10,000 (or more) before summer ends -- it is remarkably tone-deaf to declare a \"success\" of any sort. Like, stunningly so.\n\nWhich is par for the course for Kushner , a White House senior adviser and the husband of Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka, and the sort of to-the-manor-born person who seemingly just never seems to, well, get it.\n\nTake Kushner's previous foray into sounding off about the coronavirus earlier this month. (Kushner has been given some amorphous but hugely powerful role by Trump on the coronavirus task force.) Asked why medical supplies from the federal stockpile weren't being distributed to states that needed them, Kushner responded: \"The notion of the federal stockpile was it's supposed to be our stockpile. It's not supposed to be state's stockpiles that they then use.\"\n\nFirst off, \"our stockpile?\" No way, dude.\n\n\"The Strategic National Stockpile is the nation's largest supply of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out. When state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency.\"\n\nIt's long been said that Trump lives in a bubble -- surrounded by lackeys and his own self-fulfilling desire to believe what he wants about himself and the world regardless of what the facts say. But that same thing can be said of Kushner -- a child of privilege who was raised in New York City by a real-estate mogul father . (Sound familiar?)\n\nOnly someone who has spent a life looking at the average person with a sort of scientific or philosophical remove could go on TV with 60,000 Americans dead and demand that this \"great success story\" be acknowledged. Because while Kushner's point was -- and is -- clearly that things could have been much, much worse, the willingness to ignore the real-world effects of coronavirus only comes with an out-of-touchness that has been nurtured over a lifetime.\n\nBeing born into privilege isn't Kushner's fault! But his seeming blindness to what that privilege has given him -- and allowed him to avoid -- is. He'd be far better off (and so would we) if he would simply stay behind the scenes -- and away from the TV cameras -- as the country continues its fight against coronavirus."}

He is the editor of the Coronavirus Daily Brief and author of the new book \"Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles at CNN.\n\n(CNN) What is most galling as the nation faces its worse crisis since World War II is how the Trump family keeps demanding recognition for their brilliant work and also our thanks for the catastrophic mess they have helped land us all in.\n\nCase in point is Jared Kushner, who has fallen upwards throughout his life, inheriting a vast real estate empire and then making one of the worst purchases in the history of Manhattan, which was buying the office building 666 Fifth Avenue for a then-record $1.8 billion in 2007, a lemon which was only finally taken off his hands after his father-in-law became president.\n\nSo, perhaps it was only fitting that he was awarded the job of shadow secretary of state at the beginning of the Trump administration.\n\nKushner was in charge of managing the US-China portfolio, a responsibility that drew criticism, given Kushner's own business interests with China.\n\nHe also destroyed any vestige of American leadership in the Middle East with his promotion of the reckless Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his sabotage of the two-state solution in Israel.\n\nAccording to officials cited by The New York Times , early on in the Covid-19 crisis, Kushner privately agreed with his father-in-law that this whole coronavirus thing was being overblown by the lamestream media.\n\nKushner then championed a new Google site where you could go and get your virus symptoms tested. His father-in-law touted 1,700 Google engineers who were working on the site at a White House news conference in March. If that sounds like a fantasy, it was.\n\nAnd now, Kushner comes to Fox News , the Pravda of the Trump administration, to marvel on Wednesday that the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus is \"a great success story,\" claim that that \"we have all the testing we need to start opening the country\" and state his hope that \"by July, the country's really rocking again.\"\n\nThis is as more than 60,000 Americans lie dead -- more than the death toll of the Vietnam War -- and more than 1 million have been confirmed to have been infected with the virus with no end in sight. There is widespread agreement among experts that we don't have the testing capabilities to return to any semblance of normal life and also that a second wave of infections could hit the country badly later in the year.\n\nDuring World War II, the United States had Franklin Delano Roosevelt and George Marshall to navigate us through a crisis that saw the US spend more than a third of its GDP and during which more than 12 million Americans donned military uniforms.\n\nThis is the kind of thing we expect in a banana republic: the nepotistic incompetence and the demands from the public to lavish praise on the brilliant ruling family.\n\nIt would be laughable if there weren't so many lives lost already and so many more in our future.\n\nSo, Jared Kushner, we, the American public, want to thank you for your service."}

CNN's Jeremy Diamond reported that Trump erupted at his campaign manager Brad Parscale on Friday night, according to three sources familiar with the outburst.\n\n\"The goal here is to get people back to work,\" Kushner, who like his father-in-law is a wealthy real estate investor, said Wednesay morning on Fox News.\n\nBut Kushner's glib predictions also ignore the complications clouding the medical battle against coronavirus -- in the absence of proven treatments and a vaccine. They also over-simplify the huge economic uncertainties inherent in the never-before attempted task of switching an economy back on -- that to a large extent will rely on the confidence of a wary public. And while millions of Americans are desperate to get back to work, Kushner's dismissal -- or risks -- appears to reflect disdain for the working people who will pay the price if it all goes wrong.\n\nIn years to come, public health and policy experts will argue over whether the mass lockdowns turned out to be necessary and saved sufficient lives to justify the harrowing economic toll.\n\nBut right now, the country stands on the cusp of a considerable gamble without the certain knowledge of what will happen next in the fight against a highly infectious virus.\n\nHalf of states are moving ahead\n\nIn many cases, those who are most at risk if state openings prove premature are not CEOs, governors or a leading member of the Trump empire whisked to work by the Secret Service in armored SUVs.\n\nThey are lower paid workers, minorities and manual laborers, who cannot log on to a laptop for eight hours a day in their living rooms and are therefore exposed when they go back on the job.\n\nMany states appear to have concluded that they can bear the costs, in terms of rising deaths and infections, that could result from their determination to get life back to normal. It will take two to three weeks to see with the wager will go wrong given the incubation period for coronavirus.\n\nIf the medical experts turn out to have been over cautious, and the virus can be kept at bay without a heavy human toll, the leaders pushing early opening plans will be entitled to credit.\n\nTheir case could in the long run be helped by the discovery of a therapy for Covid-19. There was a glimmer of hope Wednesday when top administration health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said one trial had suggested that one drug, remdesivir , could shorten the course of disease for Covid-19 patients and could reduce mortality.\n\nAn effective treatment with no side effects that could be mass produced could significantly reduce the risk of openings and diminish the severity of any new spikes of infection.\n\nBut for now, the evidence from other nations -- such as Singapore and Germany, which had the virus more under control than it is in the US -- is that even careful openings can cause a rise in infections.\n\nAn administration which, in tax reform and assault on the regulatory state, has long sided with corporations, appears to have made its choice that the economic collapse -- which is cataclysmic -- means that it's time to unleash the economy.\n\nOn Tuesday, for instance, Trump forced the nation's meat packing plants to stay open , declaring them a critical piece of the nation's infrastructure. He acted despite warnings by workers in the industry, who are disproportionately Hispanic and African American that they are in grave danger of fatal illness.\n\n\"The eternal lockdown crowd can make jokes on television but the reality is is that the data's on our side and President Trump has created a pathway to safely reopen our country,\" Kushner said on Fox.\n\nIn fact, the data suggests exactly the opposite.\n\nIt doesn't appear that any state meets the vague, advisory White House guidelines calling for a \"downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period\" before any opening.\n\nBut multiple states are easing lockdown requirements or letting them lapse. Many southern governors appear keen on pleasing Trump politically and appeasing the conservative media machine -- despite their still growing or high infection rates.\n\nThe opening gathers speed\n\nTexas plans to come back on line on Friday at reduced pace, with restaurants for instance operating at 25% capacity. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, said his state would take \"safe, smart\" steps to open up from May 4. The state's biggest counties, Miami Dade, Broward and Palm Beach will not be included for now.\n\nStay-at-home orders meant to flatten the curve of infections in hard hit areas like New York, the Washington, DC, metro area and California will largely stay in place.\n\nThe fear of public health experts is that some of the states that are opening are yet to reach the peak of infections. They worry meanwhile that the lack of a comprehensive tracing operation, despite the administration's inflated claims for its testing program will make it tough to snuff out new infections until it's too late to stop localized epidemics.\n\nIn Georgia, which angered even Trump with its aggressive opening, deaths could nearly double by August because of eased restrictions, according to a model shared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA coalition of public health and medical associations called on the administration on Wednesday to put in place stringent precautions before states ease shelter-in-place orders.\n\nThey called for \"capacities for widespread testing, contact tracing, patient management and the public health and health care workforces and medical supplies necessary for these critical activities,\" as well as new protections for health care workers and capacity in the hospital system.\n\nBut there is little sign that Trump, who has made weeks of misleading claims about the prowess of the federal government's testing plan, is taking any of this particularly seriously.\n\n\"I don't know that all of that is even necessary,\" the President said, halfway through a week in which the White House has made its top public health officials far less visible.\n\n\"You have some governors that love the tests, you have others that like doing it a different way, an old fashioned way with some testing,\" the President said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence played into the impression that the White House is not fully on board with continued social distancing when he failed to wear a mask in a hospital visit on Tuesday.\n\nAnd Trump registered contempt for long-term precautions when he said he didn't like the idea of Major League Baseball playing its season at sequestered venues in Arizona with no fans.\n\n\"I'd like to see the Yankees play at Yankee Stadium,\" Trump said. \"I think they'd be able to play at Yankee stadium with obviously smaller crowds, and then the crowds would start to build as things get to be a little bit better.\"\n\nA wary public\n\nThere are plentiful signs that most Americans are far less sure than some of their political leaders that it's safe to return to normal life.\n\nA recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College survey finds that majorities of Americans believe it's a bad idea to return to everyday life without further coronavirus testing.\n\nSome 85% say it's a bad idea for students to return to school without more testing, including 94% of Democrats, 89% of independents and 71% of Republicans.\n\nAnd 80% of respondents say it's a bad idea to open restaurants for people to eat in them, including 63% of Republicans, 82% of independents and 92% of Democrats.\n\nIn Georgia, which began to open up at the end of last week, business has been sparse at many restaurants and businesses that are trying to revive their customer base. It is also unclear whether the catering trade -- often characterized by fairly thin profit margins can make ends meet on reduced capacity.\n\nEven at the meat packing plants that Trump helped stay open by absolving owners of liability if workers get sick, staffing disruption seems certain to linger.\n\n\"It's terrible,\" one processing plant worker told CNN's Omar Jimenez in Wisconsin on Wednesday. \"We all have families we have to think about. Of course I'm scared to come back, we're seeing positives daily.\""}

Friday marks May 1, and for millions of Americans, rents and mortgage payments will be due. Unemployment benefits are one of the key forms of financial aid that are helping families plug the gap.\n\n\"A number in the low millions may be a relief compared to earlier this month, but it's objectively a horrifying statistic,\" said Nick Bunker, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab.\n\nRising joblessness will weigh on incomes and consumer spending, which is the largest contributor to the economy. Personal incomes fell 2%, and personal consumption expenditures dropped 7.5% in March, according to the Commerce Department\n\nAnd it's uncertain how many more people will lose their jobs in the weeks to come. Although businesses like retailers, hotels and restaurants were among the first to lay off and furlough workers early in the pandemic, economists predict layoffs will start to impact white-collar jobs, too. Meanwhile, a rout in the oil market is expected to lead to bankruptcies in the sector , making job losses worse in the energy industry. One big question now is whether initial claims will peak above or below 40 million in this crisis, said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US.\n\nAs part of a $2 trillion CARES Act package signed last month, Congress expanded unemployment benefits to include an extra $600 per week on top of state benefits, for up to four months. They also expanded the eligibility requirements to include independent contractors, gig workers and self-employed workers.\n\nNot all claims result in paid benefits.\n\nContinued jobless claims, representing workers who filed for their second week of benefits or more, stood at nearly 18 million in the week ended April 25, after seasonal adjustments, up from 15.8 million in the prior week, the Department of Labor said.\n\nMany claimants have faced delays in receiving their benefits, as state labor agencies have scrambled to update their intake systems in response to guidance from the Department of Labor. President Trump signed the CARES Act on March 27, and according to a statement from the Department of Labor released on Wednesday, it took until April 28 for all 50 states to get the emergency payments up and running.\n\nSo far, Hawaii, Kentucky and Georgia have seen the largest percentages of their labor forces file for first-time jobless benefits. About 29% of workers in Hawaii have filed first-time unemployment claims since March 14, as its tourism industry has come to a standstill.\n\nLooking ahead to a historically weak jobs report\n\nNext week, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its official jobs report for April.\n\nThat report is expected to show the US unemployment rate surged to 14% in April. That would be the highest since the monthly data series began in 1948. During the Great Depression, annual estimates show the unemployment rate peaked at 24.9% in 1933.\n\nThe nation's official unemployment rate is estimated from a survey of about 60,000 households — not the number of unemployment claims. To be counted as \"unemployed\" in that report, survey respondents need to have been out of work but available to work, and actively searched for a job in the prior four weeks.\n\nIt will take time for America's labor market to bounce back from the pandemic. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said it would be a while until February's historically low unemployment rate of 3.5% would be achieved again.\n\nHow high the jobless rate will go and how long it will take to come down again will depend on the shape and pace of the economic recovery."}

Over the course of four seasons of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, the titular characters have fought off the armies of the Horde, learned how to control their own elemental powers, and even saved the fabric of time and space from destruction. But as the exclusive trailer for the fifth and final season makes clear, the stakes couldn't be higher now that they're face-to-face with the planet-conquering army of Horde Prime.\n\nWhen we last left our heroes, Adora (Aimee Carrero) had destroyed the magic sword that transforms her into She-Ra rather than let it be used as a world-destroying weapon. With Etheria once again part of the normal universe (after having been transported to a pocket dimension by a previous She-Ra many years ago), it became vulnerable to Horde Prime. The galactic tyrant transported both Catra (AJ Michalka) and Glimmer (Karen Fukuhara) on board his flagship. Though they've been enemies for most of the show, the two now find themselves confronted by someone more dangerous than either could have imagined.\n\n\"Horde Prime has no space in his empire for individuality; everything needs to be a reflection of his own ego,\" showrunner Noelle Stevenson tells EW. \"Characters like Glimmer and Catra, who have been striving for self-individuation this whole time, to be told that 'you’re both cogs in this machine and will be used to flatten the universe and make everything uniform,' I think that's the most horrifying thing they’ve been confronted with.\"\n\nBuilding on the scary vibes, the season 5 trailer features a haunting cover of the She-Ra theme song, \"Warriors,\" courtesy of Michalka. That song will be available to stream or purchase as part of the series soundtrack that will become available on May 8. That same day, Michalka has new music coming from Aly & AJ, her group with her sister.\n\nSeason 5 of She-Ra hits Netflix on May 15. Watch the new trailer above.\n\nRelated content:"}

Here, he shares his take on Cops ‘R’ Us, people stepping out of a challenge for food, Kim’s return performance, the Edge of Extinction race for coconuts, and what’s coming up next.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: There are a lot of fascinating relationships this season, but Sarah and Tony have to take the cake. Even though Sarah sometimes looks like she wants to murder Tony — as we saw here in the aftermath of the Sophie vote — they always seem to come back together. Could you ever trust Tony as an alliance partner after some of the stuff he has pulled on votes in Cagayan and again here?\n\nJEFF PROBST: I love the Tony/Sarah partnership. It should be a new CBS comedy. You can hear the promo: “You won’t believe the shenanigans these two wackadoodles get up to in this week’s hilarious new episode of Cops R Us! Immediately following Survivor. This Wednesday on CBS.”\n\nI think it’s the fact that they do continue to trust each other that makes the partnership so fun to watch. It feels real. I believe them when they argue and I believe them when they come back together. I can imagine them working together as police offers in the exact same way they strategize on Survivor. It’s a push-pull relationship, but when push threatens to turn to shove they always seem to come together and unite. There is clearly so much trust and love for each other.\n\nAs for me, at this point, I would trust Tony more than Sarah! Yes, Tony is a handful and Sarah does a great job with him. But Sarah is just as powerful a player, and just as good at lying as anybody who has ever played. I think if both of them plead their absolute loyalty to each — and I had to pick which one would ultimately be true to the other — it would be a razor-thin call, but I think Tony would ultimately fall on the sword and be loyal to Sarah and Sarah would take out Tony. That is intended to be more of a compliment to Sarah than a dig. She brings that out of people. Even her competitors root for her. I think that’s the mark of a great player. And this season has a lot of them.\n\nImage zoom CBS\n\nYou sent the Edge of Extinction group out on a challenge to carry back 20 coconuts from the other side of the island, with the first six folks to finish getting two Fire Tokens. I’m sure you all had your guesses in terms of who would make the cut, so who surprised you either in terms of making the top six, or not making it?\n\nThese “effort tasks” as we labeled them, have really illuminated how far Survivor players will go to win this game. That Edge of Extinction challenge was BRUTAL. And yet you saw everybody giving everything they had to finish. Rob getting injured was definitely a surprise. That fall really took a toll on him. It doesn’t look like much, but he banged it pretty hard. Getting injured on Survivor is much worse than getting injured at home. At home, you take some Advil, you ice, you elevate, you eat, you sleep, you call your doctor, you ice some more, you elevate some more, you watch TV, you get physical therapy, the list of ways you can address it are numerous.\n\nOn Survivor, you do nothing. And on the Edge, it’s so much worse because you are so completely depleted. There is so little gas in the tank when you wake up and you still have to find a way to get through each day. Then you find out you have to gather 20 coconuts and it seems almost…impossible. Just damn near totally impossible to do. But everybody else starts, so you start. And that is how it goes every day.\n\nNobody surprised me. There is no way to handicap this kind of a task. I feel it is my duty to keep reminding everybody that these are 20 winners. They are the best of the best. So, when you measure one against the other it’s very misleading. They have all proven they can dominate the game. Now you have 20 dominating players going against each other, so you are really thin slicing. I remain so impressed with this group. I am running out of hyperbole. They’ve given us the greatest season we could ever ask for and that’s exactly what we saw on the Edge. Total effort by everybody.\n\nYou had Kim, Michele, and Nick all stepping down to take food in the immunity challenge, even though they were all close to winning immunity. How much did that surprise you in an all-winners season, especially with Kim and Michele later saying they regretted the decision?\n\nI think this is a really interesting question given what I just said about them all being winners and pushing themselves as hard as they can. There’s a crazy mind game that goes on during an endurance challenge, at least that’s been my observation. The challenge begins and immediately players start to internally assess their chances. How long can I last? How much pain can I endure? If I lose, who else do I need to lose? Who do I want to win? Damn this is hurting more than I thought. I can’t let anyone know I want to stop. But I might stop. How long has it been? Jeff, come on, tell us…how long have we been up there? Two minutes?!! Whaaat! I’m gonna stop. Nope, gonna go a bit longer.\n\nThey are constantly assessing the situation, checking the competition, looking for any way to relieve the pain. When you add the possibility of a food temptation, you now have another variable. Unless I think I have a great shot at winning, I might be better to try and fuel myself so I can at least get something of value out of this challenge. It’s like trying to time when to sell a losing stock? Or what offer to take on a house that isn’t drawing many visitors? How do I get the most value out of this situation?\n\nAnd in this case, there is a ticking clock. If you don’t say yes very fast, the food will disappear. So you only have a few seconds to make your decision. I know they said they regretted it later, but I think they are being a bit hard on themselves. You make decisions in this game in the moment. When they work, you’re happy, when they don’t, you second guess. It’s no different for me as a host or producer. You can second guess forever. One thing I have worked on in the last many years is the idea of “always moving forward.” You make a decision and you immediately start moving in that direction. Own the decision, commit to it and move forward. I didn’t question their decision.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nImage zoom Robert Voets/CBS\n\nAll roads led to Kim the first time she played in One World as she was at the social and strategic center of the game in what I still consider to be the most dominant winning performance ever. This time, it looked like she was always a bit on the outside looking in. What did you make of her game this season as she had to work hard all the way from day 1 just to stay alive?\n\nSurvivor is hard. That’s what I say. Kim was not off her game, she wasn’t outclassed, she didn’t play poorly. Survivor is hard. If you win one time, you are in the Hall of Fame. That’s how hard it is to play Survivor. Kim started in a hole in episode 1 because of some silly poker tournament that nobody ever thought would matter. But everything matters in Survivor. Survivor is hard. She never quit. She kept trying to turn the game. Her instincts were spot on. She knew when she was being told lies and she tried to maneuver, it just didn’t come together.\n\nIt must be so incredibly frustrating to not be able to control your own fate. Kim has always been a favorite, dating back to when we first met her in casting. She has this rare combination of a bright light of positive energy that makes you want to engage with her — and the tenacity of a tiger that will eat your young if you leave them unprotected. When you think of those two qualities together, it’s very powerful because she can seduce you into letting your guard down and then she will devour you. The fact that it didn’t happen this time only speaks to one thing — Survivor is hard. But the Edge offers hope for everybody. One person will get back in.\n\nWe’ve got five more hours of Survivor in the next two weeks. What can you say about next week’s week penultimate episode?\n\nAh, that makes me sad. I don’t want this season to end. Next week is a giant episode. Two hours. We rarely do two-hour episodes, but there was so much story happening we had to expand on the fly. And the finale is going to be nearly three hours. These players all deserve such giant praise. They played at a level that may never be repeated. Every single second of every single day. Whether in the game trying to stay alive or on the Edge trying to get back in the game. It was relentless. Keep your seatbelts fastened. This ride is not over.\n\nEnjoy an exclusive deleted scene from this week’s episode above, and make sure to check out our full episode recap as well as Jeff Probst talking about whether the show will make it to season 50.

Here, the 28-year-old country crooner talks about what he learned from wearing that space suit — and how he kind of bent the truth to get on the popular show.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What's it been like watching yourself on The Masked Singer?\n\nHUNTER HAYES: I am my worst critic. I've always been that way. The show magnified it. I was very hard on myself during the taping. Now on the other end, it's nice to kind of chill out and not get stressed, rather just kind of enjoy the fun of it. Being so far removed allows me to see how everybody else sees it, which is just having fun.\n\nIs there anything in particular you learned about yourself while doing this show, other than maybe finding out that you're claustrophobic or something?\n\nUm, luckily I wasn't. In one of the questionnaires when you sign up, they ask you if you're claustrophobic. I've had both experiences. I've had experiences where I have zero problem being in a confined space but I've also had, like, mild panic attacks being in confined spaces. But I didn't want them to know that. I won't say I lied, but I didn't really tell them about the potential for claustrophobia. Thank God it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. I had an advantage with my mask. I could see almost everything. My view was great. It wasn't as hard to breathe in my mask as I knew it was for others in their costumes. If I learned anything about myself, there were a couple things. In the first episode, I realized how powerful emotions can be behind a vocal. I didn't really have much movement with the first song and I knew that if I was going to make it to round 2, I had to just express everything. All the reasons that I wanted to do the song had to come through every line that I sang. It wasn't about perfection, it was about emotion. After getting the response that I got from that, I realized how important that is in general. When I sang \"Signed, Sealed and Delivered,\" I let go of what I thought the Astronaut should be. I just started goofing off and being myself and focused less on throwing people off. I mean it's always been part of my story, writing songs and being honest with the world. But starting from that pure emotional place has kind of risen back, has come back as a priority.\n\nYour costume did look hotter than hell to wear.\n\nYeah, it was very hot. Luckily, it wasn't too heavy.\n\nOkay so full disclosure, we figured out early on that it was you. Let's go over some of these clues that made it a slam dunk for us. The number 500 was mentioned in reference to your self-titled debut album, which accumulated more than 500 million on demand streams. Is that correct?\n\nYeah. though that sounds a little pretentious. It was a reference to a couple of different things and couple of different sort of statuses. We didn't want to be too specific so it felt kind of a safe but subtle. I'm impressed that you picked up on it 'cause nobody else did.\n\nWow. Okay. Now, the image of the French horn. Was that a nod to your Cajun ancestry?\n\nYeah, that was a reference to growing up and playing Cajun music and trying to learn how to speak French. I never succeeded. But you know, the effort was made.\n\nLet's talk about when you performed \"Signed, Sealed and Delivered.\" You said that was a song from a dear friend. We know that you performed with Stevie Wonder at the ACM awards and on Dancing With the Stars.\n\nYep, absolutely. That was Stevie. It was like meeting royalty and getting to work with royalty. The personal side of Stevie is the best part of him. After meeting a hero like that, seeing the human that he is and getting to know him ... the effort he put into just staying in touch! He sends me song ideas and he's always just been really supportive. It's weird to call a hero 'a dear friend.' But I felt like that was a really accurate way to describe him, the way that he cares about fellow music makers.\n\nAnd finally your comment about needing a little help from someone from an organized crime family. Was that a shout out to Robert Duvall?\n\nYeah, that was a Robert Duvall reference, which got really out of hand on set because there were tons of jokes made about that. But yeah, that was definitely Robert Duvall.\n\nLet's say another famous singer like yourself came up and asked whether he or she should do this show. What would you say?\n\nDo it and just make sure you're having fun. It is a competition, but the reason that I was really excited about it was that it's not a competition about technicality. It's about individuality. I think that's why it's been such success. That's why I fell in love with it was because it's like no other contest on TV. You have to just go in and have fun with it. That sounds simple, but it's really easy to get caught in the technicalities of dance moves and choreography and staging. But at the end of the day, the times where you just have fun were the times where I felt like I had a chance of moving on to the next round and. I would encourage anybody to do it!\n\nThe Masked Singer airs Wednesdays on Fox.\n\nRelated content:"}

But when the coronavirus pandemic halted production across the world, her directorial debut on the CW series moved into the coveted spot.\n\n\"You want it to be exciting and climactic and really building its energy, so I wanted to honor that,\" the actress tells EW of her fateful episode. \"There was a little extra pressure.\"\n\nAmick has been directing since 2015, beginning with one of her daughter Mina Tobias' music videos. And while Riverdale has kept her busy playing Alice Cooper, the uptight, haunted mother of Betty (Lili Reinhart), since 2017, she has long dreamed of stepping behind the camera as well.\n\nShe finally got her shot for \"Killing Mr. Honey,\" which was originally intended as the 19th installment of the 22-episode season. Now it will have to stand as the conclusion — and Amick warns that it ends on a cliffhanger.\n\nIn the photos above and below, EW has an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at Amick's directing days on Riverdale. And ahead of the episode's May 6 airing, we called up Amick to discuss her experiences calling the shots, what it was like pulling double duty, and how working with David Lynch early in her career inspired her as an auteur.\n\nImage zoom Kailey Schwerman/The CW\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: How long have you had an itch to direct, and how did this episode come about?\n\nMÄDCHEN AMICK: I moved to L.A. at 16, and got Twin Peaks at 17. I would say around my mid-20s, I had it in the back of my mind that I wanted to be more than just an actress and be a storyteller, but so many things in my career made me busy and made me feel like, \"Oh, I don’t have time to step behind the camera. I have to keep busy and focused on staying in front of the camera.\" This was in the mid-'90s, and there were a few female directors — one in particular was Diane Keaton on the original Twin Peaks — that showed me there are women doing this, but [now] there’s a little bit of this movement to get more diversity behind the camera that I benefitted from. I have to give credit to my husband and my daughter. She asked me to direct her music video, and I was honored and jumped right in. I’ve done a few music videos. I’ve directed and produced a docuseries pilot. At the beginning of Riverdale when I did that first thing, I’d started asking around and asking [creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa] and [producers] Sarah Schechter and Greg Berlanti. I said, \"Hey, guys, I really would love to direct an episode.\" They were super-supportive and excited. So it was this season that Roberto said, \"You want to direct this season?\" And I was like, \"Yes!\"\n\nRiverdale has a very specific, highly stylized aesthetic. Did that make directing easier or harder, especially when it comes to putting your own stamp on the episode?\n\nIt was easy for me. I know the show so well, inside and out. I really enjoy the storytelling and the filmmaking part of it. So I know what Roberto likes, as far as the way he likes the story to be told and unfold. That was a great template that was already in place, and I wanted to honor that. Then, I just wanted to elevate it as much as I could and get as strong as performances out of all my fellow actors, which they were great and supportive. And just push the visual boundaries as much as possible. Presenting new ways to shoot scenes, but still staying within the world and the visual look to it, and just hoping that Roberto loved it.\n\nI remember Roberto and I had a conversation: It might’ve been season 2 or season 3, but there was an episode and he said it didn’t feel very inspired. That really gave me an insight into [that] he really wants directors to come on board and love the show and be excited about the show, and then bring an inspirational take to it. That made me feel I had a little bit of freedom to run with it, and he didn’t want a cookie cutter, just make everything the same. It was nice to hear he wanted something that was inspired.\n\nWhen you directed the episode, it wasn’t meant to be the season finale, but now it is. Is that exciting? Nerve-racking?\n\nSince it's [episode] 19 of 22, you are getting to the end, so there’s usually a lot of climactic things happening. That’s a lot of responsibility, just because I want to get it right. I know we’re getting toward the end, and those last few are really important to start tying up loose ends or building to a cliffhanger. You want it to be exciting and climactic and really building its energy, so I wanted to honor that. There was a little extra pressure.\n\nDid it lead to any last-minute adjustments or changes in the storytelling?\n\nThe episode that I shot was the last episode that we completed as far as filming. We were halfway through 20 when production stopped, so I was editing when production stopped. At that point, we didn’t really know that the season would be done. It was a little bit of a holding pattern of, \"Are we just pausing and we’ll get back to it, or will our season end a little short?\" Now knowing my episode will serve as the finale for this season, obviously we’ll pick up back up next season. They’ll have to adjust some storytelling with what they had planned at the end of this season. As far as my episode, it pretty much stayed intact the way it was written. There was a new layer that came into the story that now serves as an interesting cliffhanger.\n\nImage zoom Kailey Schwerman/The CW\n\nYou also appear as Alice throughout the episode. What was it like having to pull double duty?\n\nI’m not gonna lie, it was a huge challenge. My brain was so much behind the camera that it was hard for me to switch over to being in character. I could easily slip into Alice, but I could not remember my lines, and I’m usually really good at that. I was really struggling. In one scene in particular, there’s a big confrontation that Alice has with Mr. Honey and she drives the whole scene with all of the parents, and I could not remember it, to the point where my fellow actors were whispering the lines to me to try to help me get through it. Man, it was rough. I know I’ll continue to get better with that with practice, but my brain was not in that space at all. I was full-on thinking of shots and directing my other actors, so it was a big challenge.\n\nThis episode is going to have to hold us over for a while; what can you tease about it? Would you say it’s a satisfactory end to the season?\n\nThe whole theme of the episode is the big confrontation between the kids and their awful Principal Honey, who’s just been tormenting them the whole season. So lots of really, really fun stuff. There’s a mixture of some fantasy of what they want to do to Mr. Honey and some reality of what ends up happening to Mr. Honey. So that’s the big tease.\n\nThe back half of the season angered so many Varchie and Bughead fans, and it doesn’t seem like the same instant regret Archie and Betty have had over previous kisses. What can you say about where those relationships and feelings are headed? Might Riverdale be exploding some of its most beloved relationships?\n\n[Laughs] Why? Why were they upset? No, but don’t they always teeter on that? I think Roberto loves to torture the fans, quite frankly. That’s the fun dynamic, and that is what’s classic to the Archie Comics, is you have this love triangle that’s always been between Archie, Betty, Veronica, and now we’ve thrown in Jughead into the mix. It’s complicated, but we’ll see what ends up happening at the end of senior year and where relationships really go. I know the plan for the next season is we were going to jump forward in time and see where everybody had landed, but I don’t know if that’s gonna adjust now that our season changed a bit.\n\nBoth Skeet Ulrich and Marisol Nichols had announced they were leaving at the end of this season, leaving you as the only original Riverdale parent left standing. Now that filming has ended early, does that alter their plans? Will we get any hint of where F.P. and Hermione were originally headed?\n\nAs far as the episode I directed, there wasn’t really anything different happening for their characters. It was the same story line going on. But with technically three more episodes they had planned, I’m assuming they had plans. I also know Roberto really loves Skeet and Marisol, and he told me he hopes their characters can come and go from the show depending on everyone’s availability. It’s always funny whenever some of our characters die on the show, it’s like, \"Oh, well that guarantees you’ll be on more often.\" Nobody’s ever really gone on Riverdale.\n\nDoes it feel weird to know Alice was going to be the last one left? And what might that mean for her going forward? She seems so happy with FP, it’s really sad to imagine that ending.\n\nI know! They were finally doing good. I don’t know what Roberto has planned, but yeah, poor Alice. She’s really going to be alone now. Maybe she’ll just be ruling the town, who knows? Maybe we need to start a new campaign, Mayor Alice. Obviously not until next year, but just even thinking about coming back next season and having all my O.G. homies not around on a consistent basis, it’s definitely going to be really sad. I’m absolutely going to miss them, but I know that won’t end our friendship.\n\nEarlier in the season, we had evidence Chic and Charles are working together. Will we see any answers there, and what might it mean for Alice to discover her long-lost son has betrayed her once again?\n\nWe hadn’t gotten into that for my episode. I think that was in the next few, so she hasn’t experienced the betrayal yet. I know she’s really resilient, but there’s been a lot of betrayal in this woman’s life. I think Alice is going to need some therapy next season.\n\nAnd not of the Farm variety.\n\nReal, good old-fashioned traditional therapy.\n\nWe were setting up for high school graduation to round out this season, and the characters going off to college or other futures. Will we ever get some taste of graduation, and have you any hint of where the kids will end up next year?\n\nNo, I don’t. I know the idea was we were going to jump forward in time a little bit to see what they had done. I’m assuming something brings them back to the town of Riverdale.\n\nImage zoom Kailey Schwerman/The CW\n\nCan you point to moment or visual choice that you felt defined your identity or artistic choices?\n\nJughead and Betty have a fantasy going about what they would do to Mr. Honey, and so Betty’s revenge fantasy inspires Jughead to write an essay for college submissions. We get to go into and reenact Jughead’s fantasies and his writing. I wanted to push the envelope in those scenes. You don’t want to go too far out of the way where you’re totally getting rid of reality, but I wanted to visually have some fun with breaking the rules of what you’re supposed to do with shots and how you edit them together. Jughead is all about classic storytelling, so my inspiration was Alfred Hitchcock and Citizen Kane and that kind of stuff. We did a lot of twisted shots and shots that moved in weird [ways], very Vertigo- or Citizen Kane-inspired.\n\nHow much were you influenced by the visual artistry of working with David Lynch so early in your career?\n\nHe was my mentor from the very beginning. I didn’t really know too much about filmmaking until I worked on Twin Peaks with him. He showed me you think outside the box and do things that feel and look right to you. It wasn’t until I went into the business after Twin Peaks that I realized how different and what an innovator he was. That’s always been in there as my base, to just not be afraid of taking risks. He sent me a really beautiful email my first day of directing, and just reminding me to make sure I did every single thing I want in every single shot, and to have fun.\n\nRelated content:"}

The first race is scheduled for Darlington, NASCAR's oldest superspeedway, followed by a second race at the 70-year-old, egg-shaped oval track three days later.\n\nCharlotte Motor Speedway will then host the Coca-Cola 600 on May 24 to mark 60 consecutive years the longest race on the NASCAR schedule will be held on Memorial Day weekend. The track in Concord, outside NASCAR's home base of Charlotte, will then host a Wednesday race three days later.\n\nThere will also be lower-tier Xfinity and Trucks series races at the two tracks. The North Carolina governor has said the Charlotte races can be held as long as health conditions in the area do not deteriorate.\n\n\"This has been a proactive effort to put our motorsports industry back to work and boost the morale of sports fans around the world, while at the same time keeping the health and safety of all who will be on site the top priority,\" said Marcus Smith, president and CEO of Speedway Motorsports.\n\n\"Sports fans around the world need this, a return to some sense of normalcy with live sports on TV, and NASCAR is uniquely positioned to deliver it from a competition standpoint.\"\n\nI'm ready to be back on the track and appreciate everyone's effort on safety measures. Helpfully we'll be celebrating a few more of these soon. pic.twitter.com/wzfs8uYlSp — Alex Bowman (@AlexBowman88) April 30, 2020\n\nI'm excited to get back racing. Safety is obviously the most important thing & I know NASCAR has been working to ensure that we have the necessary safety precautions in place. While it's unfortunate that there won't be fans in the stands, it's obviously necessary at this time. — Jimmie Johnson (@JimmieJohnson) April 30, 2020\n\nWe'll be missing the fans, but we've got some of the best in sports and their energy will still be felt when we strap back in. I'm looking forward to what's ahead. — Brad Keselowski (@keselowski) April 30, 2020\n\nNASCAR has set guidelines to safely hold the events using CDC guidelines on social distancing and personal protective equipment. Only essential personnel will be permitted to attend the events, and cloth face masks will be required. The entire venue will be used to maintain distancing in garage stalls and where the haulers are parked.\n\nNASCAR suspended its season March 13 with only four of its 36 scheduled races completed. The stock car series, heavily reliant on television money and sponsor payments, has vowed to complete its full schedule. The revised schedule for now stays at tracks within driving distance of Charlotte-based race teams and in states that have started reopening.\n\n\"Darlington is one of the most iconic and historic tracks in the sport and will be a tremendous backdrop when NASCAR returns to racing,'' said track President Kerry Tharp, who noted the track will now have three Cup races in one season for the first time in its history.\n\nDarlington is also scheduled to open the playoffs with the Southern 500 on Sept. 6. Because the track now has two additional dates, NASCAR will lose two Cup races from its other properties. The same goes for Speedway Motorsports, which gained one additional race so far and will have to forfeit one at another facility.\n\nAlmost all teams began returning to their race shops this week with either a reduced initial workforce or in split shifts. Now that NASCAR has told the teams where it will be racing this month, they can start preparing cars suitable for the two tracks.\n\nAlthough Florida and Texas have invited NASCAR to compete in those states without spectators, the sanctioning body is holding off on scheduling events at tracks that require air travel and hotel accommodations."}

It feels like the end of the season for our team. It just does.\"\n\nKerr's hunch could end up being correct even if the NBA does figure out a way to play games, should it fast-forward to the playoffs and do away with the rest of the regular season.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver said he would not be ready to make any recommendation on what direction the league should go until May 1 at the earliest.\n\n\"I think there is still too much uncertainty at this point to say precisely how we move forward,\" Silver told reporters on a conference call April 17. \"I'll add that the underlying principle remains the health and well-being of NBA players and everyone involved. We begin with that as paramount.\"\n\nBefore there can be games, there must be practices, and before there can be practices, there must be workouts.\n\nThe NBA said Monday that no players would be allowed to work out in their team facilities before May 8, and even then, strict social distancing and safety measures would have to be put into place.\n\nOn a conference call Monday detailing the safety protocols that will have to be adhered to, Lakers players sounded \"eager\" to make the first step toward returning to play, sources told ESPN."}

I look forward to it. I'm a guy that adjusts pretty quick, and wherever I go, like I tell people, I'm going to ball. So I'm not worried about that.\"\n\nLast month, the Texans traded a 2020 second-round NFL draft pick (No. 57 overall) to the Rams for Cooks and a 2022 fourth-round pick. Cooks joins Michael Bennett as the only players to have been traded three times since January 2017, according to ESPN Stats & Information.\n\nThe Rams acquired Cooks, and a fourth-round pick from the Patriots before the 2018 draft in exchange for a first-round pick. Los Angeles signed Cooks to a five-year, $81 million contract before the 2018 season. Cooks was drafted by the Saints in 2014 and played three seasons for New Orleans before he was traded to the Patriots.\n\nIn his two seasons in Los Angeles, Cooks had 122 catches for 1,787 yards and seven touchdowns. Although he experienced a smaller workload in 2019, while also missing two games due to multiple concussions, Cooks played an important role on the Rams' Super Bowl LIII team.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of nuances that [were] going on last year -- not just for me; but just from a team standpoint, we had a lot going on,\" Cooks said. \"At the end of the day, I dealt with some things on the field.

But it comes with the game, but that definitely is not the extreme that you should be looking from me as a player.\"\n\nCooks has had a 1,000-yard receiving season with the Saints, Patriots and Rams, according to ESPN Stats & Info. The only player in NFL history to post 1,000 receiving yards in a season with four different teams is Brandon Marshall.\n\n\"I think that Brandin brings a lot to the table,\" head coach Bill O'Brien said in his pre-draft news conference. \"He's a tremendous route runner, he's got great speed. [He's a] really good deep ball player. ... I've been asked about concussions. Yes, he's had concussions, but he's only missed two games since 2015. All of that was taken into account when we worked with Sean McVay on the trade.\"\n\nWhen he was asked about his concussions on Thursday, Cooks said he is currently healthy.\n\n\"As far as the concussions, I'm feeling great, and I look forward to playing football,\" Cooks said."}

Dalton, 32, led Cincinnati to the playoffs five times, though the Bengals lost in the wild-card round each time, and is the franchise's career leader in touchdown passes.\n\nThe move comes one week after the Bengals drafted former LSU quarterback Joe Burrow with the top overall pick. Burrow threw 60 touchdowns in 2019, an FBS record, and won the Heisman Trophy as he led the Tigers to the national championship.\n\nDalton was set to earn $17.7 million in the final season of a six-year contract worth $96 million. After the Bengals went on a spending spree this summer, Cincinnati did not have the salary-cap space to keep Dalton and sign its incoming rookie class.\n\n\"Andy will always hold a special place with this franchise, and I know that he holds a special place in my heart,\" team president Mike Brown said in a statement. \"This is a hard day for our club because we know and appreciate what a consummate professional Andy has always been. We respect and appreciate Andy, and we thank him.\"\n\n9 years\n\n204 touchdowns\n\n2,757 completions\n\nAn unquestionable impact on the community\n\n\n\nThank you, Andy! pic.twitter.com/tf4XATV0by — Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) April 30, 2020\n\nPrior to the decision to release Dalton, the Bengals tried to trade the quarterback, a source told ESPN's Josina Anderson, adding that Dalton \"requested the opportunity to see what's out there.\"\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars were one team that looked into Dalton's availability prior to his release, a source told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler. The New England Patriots, meanwhile, did not show strong interest in Dalton in recent weeks, according to Fowler.\n\nAfter the 2019 regular-season finale, a win over the Cleveland Browns, Dalton acknowledged the game may have been his last with the Bengals and reflected on his tenure with the franchise.\n\n\"This city has been our home since I got drafted here, and this city's meant a lot,\" Dalton said. \"I'm thankful for all the people that we've met. There's been a lot of good people in Cincinnati who have pushed me, my wife and my family to be better people, and we're grateful for that.\"\n\nThursday's news signaled the latest cut in an offseason full of roster overhaul in Cincinnati. By releasing Dalton and four other veterans, the Bengals cleared $41.6 million toward its 2020 cap allotment. During free agency, the Bengals spent more than $145 million to improve a franchise that finished with the league's worst record in 2019.\n\nIn nine years, Dalton was 70-61-2 as a starter, led the Bengals to the postseason from 2011 to 2015 and was a three-time Pro Bowl selection. Along with his franchise-record 204 touchdown passes, he is second in passing yards with 31,594, behind only Ken Anderson (32,838).\n\nBut Cincinnati did not win a playoff game during Dalton's tenure, continuing a drought that stretches back to January 1991 and is the longest in the NFL.\n\nAndy Dalton led the Bengals to the playoffs in each of his first five seasons but couldn't snap Cincinnati's postseason losing streak. Abbie Parr/Getty Images\n\nA series of events signaled the end of his run in Cincinnati. The team did not give him an extension leading up to the 2019 season. After the Bengals started the year with eight straight losses, coach Zac Taylor benched Dalton in favor of rookie Ryan Finley.\n\n\"He said he has to think about the future with the draft and we have to see what we have in Ryan,\" Dalton said at the time. \"That's what it came down to.\"\n\nThree games later, Dalton was reinserted into the starting lineup and led the Bengals to a win over the New York Jets on Dec. 1. Dalton passed Anderson for the franchise touchdown record during the 22-6 victory.\n\nBut Dalton finished 2019 with a Total QBR of 40.1, which ranked 27th out of 30 qualifying quarterbacks, according to ESPN Stats & Information.\n\nThroughout the offseason, it became clear that Dalton's contract would not allow the Bengals to keep him at his current salary. Cincinnati was unable to trade Dalton leading up to last week's draft. At its conclusion, Taylor declined to say whether the Bengals received any offers for the veteran quarterback.\n\nTale of Two Timelines From 2011 to 2015, Andy Dalton had the third-most wins among NFL starting quarterbacks. But after fracturing his right thumb late in the 2015 season and missing the rest of the year, his numbers went in the other direction. Andy Dalton career stats 2011-15 2016-19 Record 50-26-1 20-35-1 Games missed 3 8 Pass TDs 124 80 Total QBR 54 49 -- ESPN Stats & Information\n\nOn Thursday, Taylor said Dalton \"will always be considered a key member of the Bengals' organization.\"\n\n\"His teammates and coaches appreciate his leadership and his commitment to winning,\" Taylor said in a statement. \"Just as importantly, Andy and his wife JJ are leaving a lasting impact in the community with the incredible work their foundation has done over the years. Andy and his family have meant a lot to this team and this city, and we wish them the best in the future.\"\n\nDalton joined the Bengals in 2011 as a second-round pick out of TCU. After the league ended its lockout in 2011, he became the team's starting quarterback and helped the Bengals reach the postseason for the next five years.\n\nOff the field, Dalton and his wife ran a nonprofit foundation that raised funds for families of children with special needs throughout greater Cincinnati and in Texas, where they are from. When he was benched, fans donated money to Dalton's foundation as a tribute of thanks for his time as the team's starter.\n\nBefore his final game with the Bengals, he said that's how he wanted to be remembered.\n\n\"We wanted to make sure that we were all-in, and we've been all-in on Cincinnati since we got here,\" Dalton said. \"I hope the people see that. I've received a lot of support throughout my years here.\""}

But after 13 NFL seasons, Ginn said earlier this month that he had no intention of retiring, adding, \"I've still got a few years left in me.\"\n\nChicago had a clear need at receiver after releasing veteran Taylor Gabriel this offseason. He was fourth on the club in receptions last year, but he missed a large portion of the season because of multiple concussions. In 2018, Gabriel caught a career-high 67 passes for 688 yards.\n\nBears receivers Allen Robinson, Anthony Miller and Cordarrelle Patterson are locks to make the 53-man roster, but the bottom of the depth chart is wide-open for 2020.

This is a fantastic deal considering it sells for $60 or more everywhere else. This mini arcade includes 40 preloaded masterpieces, including Metal Slug, King of Fighters, Samurai Showdown, Fatal Fury, King of Monsters, and more. The arcade itself is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand and yet still houses a 3.5\" display and joystick controls. For a more traditional style of play, it also includes an HDMI port for playing on your TV and two external controller ports. Gamestop has both the 64GB model (with case bundle) and 128GB for preorder, They'll ship out on May 22. These VR headsets have been extremely hard to find and a May ship date is actually surprisingly soon. There are many reasons why the Quest is the best VR headset to get right now. It's completely untethered with no external sensors to set up, it's powerful enough to play games like Half-Life: Alyx, Beat Saber ( the best VR game of 2019 ), Vader Immortal, and Pistol Whip, and it's far less expensive than all the other newer generation VR headsets that have been released. The Oculus Link software which allows you to connect the Quest to a PC using a Type C cable and use it like a regular VR headset powered by your gaming PC. You can purchase the official cable for $79 . If you want to try your luck, there are reports that many generic USB Type C Gen 1 or Gen 2 cables will work like this $18 cable PS Plus membership discounts only happen a few times a year so grab this deal when you can. This membership lets you play games online (absolutely necessary for games like NBA 2K20, Madden NFL 20, FIFA 20, Overwatch, Rocket League, and more). You'll also get PS Plus exclusive discounts at the PlayStation Store as well as new free games every month. For example, right now PS Plus members get the outstanding Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and Dirt Rally 2.0 for free. Best of all, it's email delivery so you'll get your code within 24 hours. The newest Assassin's Creed game is up for preorder today. More details have emerged and you can read all about it here . Preorder it on Amazon and you won't be charged until the game actually ships out. Also your price is automatically adjusted every time a price drop that might occur without you having to do anything. Pay $1/month for four months (the normal cost of the HiFi plan is $19.99/mo). TIDAL is a music streaming service that offers 60+ million tracks and 250,000+ videos with premium quality audio. The HiFi plan upgrades the audio to lossless high-fidelity. I've never seen a prebuilt gaming PC with an RTX 2080 Ti (the fastest video card out right now) for this price. This PC is customizable on HP's website, but buying the base config has its merits. In terms of gaming, upgrading from an Intel Core i5-9600K to an Intel Core i7 is a waste... performance-wise they are identical. Also, by upgrading the RAM and storage on your own, you can save alot of money and pick your own, better parts at the same time. It's hard enough to find an RTX 2080-equipped gaming laptop for under $2000, but this one doesn't skip on any other spec either. In fact, you get a true 4K 3840x2160 display, a 9th gen Intel Core i7 processor, and plenty of RAM and SSD storage. This laptop is every bit as good for gaming but you'll save about $350 compared to the above config. The RTX 2070 video card is almost as powerful as the previous generation's GTX 1080, which used to be the most powerful mobile GPU. It should be more than enough handle any game on the 15\" 1080p display, even at 144Hz refresh rate. If you want to, you can upgrade to 12GB RAM and 512GB SSD for $180. Upgrade to a very rare and very awesome 4K Ultra HD 3840x2160 display for only $200. We reviewed a very similar OLED equipped model less than a year ago (with inferior specs) with a price tag of $2800 and we LOVED it. The ComiXology trial period is normally 30 days. ComiXology is Amazon's digital comic platform and is the largest digital retailer of American comics. The site hosts 20,000 digital comics, graphic novels, and manga from DC, Marvel, Image, Dark Horse, and more. Here's your chance to access all of it, totally free, for60 days. If you're an avid comic reader, you might want to consider continuing on afterwards, since it's only $5.99/month. You can even sign in with your Amazon account. This gaming PC boasts a 9th gen Intel Core i7 processor and the newest RTX 2080 SUPER video card. It's about 10% more powerful than the non-SUPER model and considerably more powerful than the GTX 1080 Ti. For those of you who would rather have a PC preinstalled with all the RAM and storage you'll ever need, this model has 16GB RAM and dual drive storage. If you want upgrade the RAM and hard drive yourself, you can save alot of money compared to adding pre-configured upgrades. Like the new R9 chassis, the R8 features easy toolless entry. Swapping components doesn't void the warranty. For those of you who haven't been keeping up with the Intel vs AMD CPU war, AMD has been giving Intel a run for its money with its flagship processors. The new AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-core processor is comparable to the Intel Core i7-9700, both in terms of gaming and workstation performance. It's paired with an RX 5700 XT video card, which is on par with the RTX 2070. If you want to upgrade the RAM or hard drive, I'd suggest doing it on your own. You'll save money, and the Aurora R9 allows for toolless access without voiding your warranty. IPVanish is offering 73% off its 1 year VPN plan, dropping the price to $39. That's only $3.25 a month for a service that provides some great benefits. VPN is the first and easiest step to making your internet activity a bit more anonymous. VPN is also a great way to \"trick\" a host site into thinking you're in another part of the world. That's great for watching region-locked content from streaming services like Netflix. IPVanish boasts a very user-friendly interface, doesn't hog resources, and has a zero-log policy. We also gave it a great review Want to be more productive at home? Stack Social has plenty of practical courses that can kick start your career. For under $40 per bundle you get dozens of hours of online instruction in programming, game creation, video production, ethical hacking, and more... all from the safety of your home. This deal only works for new Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers, but. Normally you'd be paying $9.99/month for this service (or $7.99/mo for Prime members). Amazon Music Unlimited works alot like the paid ad-free versions of Spotify or Pandora. Get access to millions of songs and playlists that you can stream anywhere. Sling's Happy Hour promotion is offering free Sling Blue from 5pm to midnight (normally $30/month). You can keep up with live news about the COVID virus from CNN, MSNBC, HLN, and Fox News, or just lose yourself in family friendly TV shows from HGTV, Food Network, A&E, Bravo, TNT, Comedy Central, Cartoon Network, The Discovery Channel, Nick Jr, and more.

Laptops definitely have more versatility when raw horsepower isn't a factor. Gamers, however, are a different story. No matter how far gaming laptops have come, they still pale in comparison to the benefits of the gaming desktop PC. The advantages are numerous. A gaming PC is massively more powerful than a gaming laptop at the same price point. A gaming PC can be upgraded to keep up with the times. The vast majority of laptops cannot be upgraded other than the RAM and hard drive, thus locking you in until you buy yet another new laptop. A gaming PC gives you the flexibility of a better, larger monitor. Yes, you can attach an external monitor to your laptop, but then you've spent needless dollars on your built-in display. The gaming PC offers better ergonomics compared to your traditional laptop setup.

Despite the fact that the G5 model is not as pricey as Alienware, it still boasts a toolless chassis so you can easily upgrade your memory and hard drive.

Our editors have screened this week’s biggest new streaming film releases to gauge whether they’re worth your time and money.\n\nBelow you’ll find micro-reviews of the two most notable new streaming releases. One is an intriguing new take on the zombie movie , and the other is a documentary on the origins of Netflix -- offered by one of its chief rivals, Amazon Prime\n\nHow to Watch Blood Quantum: Shudder\n\nLoading\n\nBetween the groundbreaking Night of the Living Dead and a decade of The Walking Dead on weekly TV, it’s difficult to imagine there being a fresh spin left to be made on the zombie genre but the new horror-thriller Blood Quantum, now streaming exclusively on Shudder, does just that.Directed by Jeff Barnaby, a First Nations filmmaker, Blood Quantum is set in 1981 among the Mi’gmaq, one of the indigenous peoples of Canada. The film follows the residents of Red Crow who discover they are immune to a zombie outbreak. The premise of Barnaby’s film plays on the tragic irony that, historically, indigenous Americans died in huge numbers due to the germs and illnesses they were exposed to by outsiders and invaders. Here, their immunity keeps them alive and strong -- provided they aren’t overrun and devoured by the infected hordes.The movie looks at the zombie genre through the prism of postcolonialism where the characters live in poverty, there’s substance abuse and petty crime, and there’s precious little help or care from the outside world. While the uniqueness of its milieu -- shot with a gritty, earthy, you-are-there quality -- and its social commentary are among the film’s strongest elements, Blood Quantum also offers some fun, B-movie gore and gruesome kills to enjoy.Indigenous North Americans’ lore has been used as fodder for horror movies before (e.g., the Wendigo) but they themselves have often been relegated to supporting players in these films (if they’re even included at all). While the cast’s performances here aren’t all uniformly strong, their characters’ experiences and world views make them compelling protagonists in a story where despair and survival were already issues to reckon with before the dead rose.-- Review by Jim Vejvoda\n\nHow to Watch Netflix vs. the World: Amazon Prime\n\nLoading\n\nNetflix Spotlight: May 2020 14 IMAGES\n\nNetflix may be one of the most dominant forces in entertainment today, but it wasn’t that long ago the company was simply an upstart trying to beat rental juggernaut Blockbuster Video at its own game. Netflix vs. The World is an entertaining and informative documentary that traces the company’s evolution from plucky startup to streaming titan.Directed by Shawn Cauthen, the documentary features interviews from numerous former Netflix and Blockbuster employees, as well as various entertainment analysts and journalists [Editor’s note: IGN’s David Griffin is among the interviewees]. The film is basically divided into three acts covering the early origins of Netflix, the competitive rivalry between Netflix and Blockbuster Online, and Netflix’s shift from DVD rentals to streaming content.It’s a lot of ground to cover in the span of 100 minutes. The energetic, humorous presentation helps distill this information both quickly and easily, with Netflix vs. The World striking a lighthearted tone similar to that of Netflix’s own docu-series The Toys That Made Us. And if the tone of some of the Netflix employee interviews is overly self-congratulatory at times, at least the film is able to balance those out with more objective commentary from outsiders. Even so, it’s hard not to wish this material were spread out over the course of multiple episodes and given more room to breathe. Or barring that, if the focus were narrowed a bit. The last act in particular feels rushed, without enough attention paid to the massive paradigm shift that came with Netflix pivoting to original content over established IP.It’s the middle act that’s the most compelling and fleshed out. In hindsight, it’s easy to misremember Blockbuster Online as a doomed attempt to outmaneuver a much younger and more tech-savvy enemy, but as this doc makes clear, Blockbuster actually made a pretty strong counteroffensive before ultimately being brought down by the Netflix-induced collapse of the video rental market. Netflix vs. The World shows us how the current entertainment landscape could have been a vastly different place if not for a few bad business decisions, and that alone makes this documentary well worth watching.-- Review by Jesse Schedeen For more new movies on VOD and streaming, check out what we thought of True History of the Kelly Gang, Robert the Bruce, and Bad Education"}

Inspired by Siri, he left to start Timista, a smart lifestyle assistant.\n\nWhen the two joined forces to co-found Aiden.ai, the combination was potent — one was a consummate marketer, the other, a specialist in machine learning. Their goal: create an AI-driven marketing analyst that offered actionable advice in real time.\n\nHumans who manage ad campaigns must analyze vast amounts of numbers, but Outtier and Camillieri envisioned a tool that could make optimization recommendations in real time. Analytics are vast and unwieldy, so theirs was a no-brainer proposition with a market crying out for solutions.\n\nThe company’s first office was at Bloom Space in Gower Street, London. It was just a handful of hot desks and a nearby sofa shared with four other startups. That summer, they began in earnest to build the company. A few months later, they had a huge opportunity when the still 100% bootstrapped company was selected for Techcrunch Disrupt’s Startup Battlefield competition.\n\nInterviewed by TechCrunch, they explained their proposition: Marketers wanted to know where a digital marketing campaign was getting the most traction: Twitter or Facebook. You might need to check several dashboards across multiple accounts, plus Google analytics to compile the data — and even if you conclude that one platform is outperforming the other, that might change next week as users shift attention to Instagram, potentially wasting 60% of ad spend.\n\nAiden was intended to feel like just another co-worker, relying on natural language processing to make the exchange feel chatty and comfortable. It queried data from multiple dashboards and quickly compiled it into flash charts, making it easy to find and digest.\n\nEventually, instead of managing 10 clients, marketing analysts would be able to manage 50 using dynamic predictions as well as visualizations. Aiden incorporated Outtier’s expertise into its algorithms so it could suggest how to tweak a Facebook campaign and anticipate what was going to happen.\n\nWas appearing at Disrupt a significant moment? “It was a big deal for us,” says Outtier. “The exposure gave us ammunition to raise our first round. And being part of the Disrupt Battlefield alumni gave us many meaningful networking and PR opportunities.”\n\nA few weeks later the company had raised a seed round of $750,000. But not without difficulty. By this time Outtier was in the latter stages of pregnancy. Raising money under these circumstances was difficult, but, she says, “it can be done. It’s tougher than ‘normal circumstances.’ It’s a bit like running a marathon, but with a fridge on your back.”"}

After revelations of Patton’s former ties to a branch of the KKK came to light, Utah’s Attorney General and the University of Utah froze their relationships with the company. Now, the company will suspend all of its contracts in the state.\n\nFollowing the actions by the state AG’s office, Banjo announced that it would suspend all of its state contracts in Utah, “not ingesting any government data or providing any services to government entities” until an audit could be conducted. Banjo signed a $20.7 million contract with the state of Utah in 2019, a relationship set to span five years.\n\n“The Utah Attorney General’s office is shocked and dismayed at reports that Banjo’s founder had any affiliation with any hate group or groups in his youth,” Reyes’ office said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “Neither the AG nor anyone in the AG’s office were aware of these affiliations or actions. They are indefensible. He has said so himself. ”\n\nIn the investigation on Patton, OneZero revealed that not only did Patton have ties to active KKK members at the age of 17, but that in 1990 he drove a car past a synagogue in a Nashville suburb while a KKK member shot at the building. Following the incident, he reportedly went into hiding at a white supremacist training camp. According to the reporting, Patton’s affiliation with white supremacists continued into his adulthood after he enlisted in the U.S. Navy, though Patton frames those ties as solely during his youth, after he “was taken in” by white supremacists while living on the street.\n\nIn a statement to TechCrunch and published on the company’s blog, Patton expressed remorse for his actions while not directly addressing how his violent, extremist past never came up when telling his own story as a founder:\n\n“I have worked every day to be a responsible member of society. I’ve built companies, employed hundreds and have worked to treat everyone around me equally. In recent years, I’ve sought to create technologies that stop human suffering and save lives without violating privacy. I know that I will never be able to erase my past but I work hard every day to make up for mistakes. This is something I will never stop doing.”\n\nOnce a proximity social networking app, Banjo pivoted in recent years to become a real-time intelligence platform for police departments and public officials. Its core product, Live Time, purports to provide “life-saving information in seconds” in order to mobilize emergency responses, but has faced criticism for its surveillance-driven mission. As Vice recently observed, the company’s desire to conduct realtime AI-powered monitoring on public surveillance camera feeds is “something that has terrified security and civil liberties experts for years.”\n\nReyes noted that while he “believe[s] Mr. Patton’s remorse is sincere,” the Utah AG’s office would suspend its use of Banjo while a third-party investigates the state’s implementation for “issues like data privacy and possible bias,” suggesting that other state agencies using Banjo should follow suit.\n\n“Banjo’s mission is to save lives and minimize human suffering to help first responders in emergency situations while not invading people’s civil liberties and rights,” the company wrote in a blog post announcing plans to pause state contracts. “We are looking forward to the audit to show that we can build technology to help save lives and protect people’s rights.”"}

It’s even more complicated when you’re competing on the home assistants front, a technically complex, capital-intensive future platform into which both tech giants have dumped substantial sums.\n\nOver the past few years, the small smart home startup Josh.ai has attempted to do just that, capitalizing on public distrust of the big voice platforms to sell an intelligent assistant to users weary of sticking a Google or Amazon-owned microphone in their homes. The company has built its business catering to customers seeking professionally installed pricey outfits in their home, costing upwards of $10,000 on the high end.\n\nThe company just secured its largest funding round to date, an $11 million Series A round, which brings the startup’s total funding to $22 million. A spokesperson for Josh.ai said their investors have asked not to be named, though he confirmed the round was led by corporate investors.\n\nFor people with an Echo Dot or Google Mini in their home, Josh.ai’s approach feels familiar. The platform boasts a number of third-party integrations, so you can use the platform to switch off lights, turn on devices, play music and answer some simple commands. Basically, the bulk of home-centric commands popular on Google Assistant and Alexa.\n\nThe startup recently introduced Josh Micro, its own take on the Echo Dot. It has a futuristic vibe and, because it’s installed by professionals, users are privy to a sleek look with wires neatly tucked away inside walls. CEO Alex Capecelatro says their competitors in the professionally installed space have been pushing wall-mounted screens with UIs that often aren’t updated and don’t age well. He hopes their more low-key display-free devices can keep less focus on the hardware and more attention on their software.\n\n“Our philosophy is that you shouldn’t be talking to a puck, it should feel fully immersive,” he says.\n\nCapecelatro had originally seen the best path to existing alongside Google and Amazon as working with them and leveraging their platforms, but he soon found that not working with them proved to be the startup’s biggest asset.\n\n“In terms of direction, what became really clear in the past three years was the importance of privacy,” Capecelatro told TechCrunch. “A lot of our clients are just people who care about their privacy; it’s part of every conversation.”\n\nOn the tech side, Capecelatro says the startup’s platform is designed around its own natural language processing stack, so most voice requests can be processed locally, though the startup does leverage tech built by Google and Microsoft to handle speech-to-text processes. While the company uses anonymized data to improve its services, the startup has also introduced specific software features to keep privacy-focused users satisfied including their own take on a smart home incognito mode.\n\nThere are few silver bullets in smart home tech, and robust third-party support often leaves room for uncertainty, which in Josh’s case can mean the difference between lights turning on or staying off. Capecelatro says ensuring smooth compatibility with supported devices has been a pretty big focus for their engineering team.\n\n“The more things we work with, the more things we have to QA and the more things that could be impacted,” he says.\n\nWhile Capecelatro says that around 80-85% of their business goes to single-family homes, he says the startup is starting to find business in commercial sectors, outfitting hotels and condo buildings.\n\n“The reality is we’ve found that the professional installed space is a really big market that the consumer companies don’t really think about,” Capecelatro says. “I think for us the likely future is that we’ll focus on areas where you have a professional installer in a non-residential arena.”\n\nThe company says the pandemic has actually given their business a bump, with April being their best month of sales to date as homeowners stuck in their houses look to finally act on long-considered home improvement projects."}

Now, the firm says it has closed a second fund in the same vein, this time with $515 million in capital commitments.\n\nAs general partner Chris Dixon — who leads the fund with general partner Katie Haun — tells Fortune: “It’s very rare that major, new computing paradigms come along, and we think this is on the scale of cloud and mobile for the Internet.”\n\nCertainly, the firm has less competition for crypto deals at the moment than it might have back in 2018. Many VCs pulled back last year, with overall funding in 2019 down 28% from 2018’s peak of $4.3 billion, according to CB Insights.\n\nBitcoin and the cryptocurrency markets were also hammered, along with the broader stock market in a downturn sparked by the COVID-19 crisis, causing some to conclude they are as vulnerable to a lot of other instruments to stock market shifts.\n\nA big upswing since — along with this obvious endorsement by a16z — could turn those trends around, however. Indeed, the entire market capitalization of cryptocurrencies jumped $35.3 billion in 24 hours as of 2:19 p.m. Singapore time, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com and reported by CNBC.\n\nBitcoin, specifically, which fell below $4,000 last month, shot up to $9,388.30 by earlier today (though, as this is being written, it has slipped to $8,695.41).\n\nIndustry participants attribute the rally to central bank monetary policy and the “bitcoin halving” that’s expected next month, when for the third time in the network’s history, the reward for mining a block will be divided by two.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz has invested directly in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with a range of other bets that include Coinbase, the crypto lender Compound and Anchorage, a cryptocurrency custody service.\n\nIt’s also a member of both the Libra Association and the Celo Alliance for Prosperity, both of which are inviting developers to build decentralized mobile apps that are based on their own cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo drum up even more deal flow, a16z last month kicked off a free, seven-week program for cryptocurrency startups that aims to educate and “supplement — not replace — the many other excellent programs and resources that help founders learn about building tech startups,” Dixon wrote of the school late last year.\n\nThe firm isn’t taking equity in the startups as part of the program, it says. Instead, it’s apparently looking to build connections to and between founders who it might want to work with it in the future."}

For the most part, though, these changes are only accelerating some of the strategic moves the organization already made in the last few years.\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the open-source Cloud Foundry project, it’s a Platform-as-a-Service that’s in use by the majority of Fortune 500 enterprises. After a lot of technical changes, which essentially involved building out support for containers and adding Kubernetes as an option for container orchestration next to the container tools Cloud Foundry built long before the rise of Google’s open-source tool, the technical underpinnings of the project are now stable. And as Childers has noted before, that now allows the project to refocus its efforts on developer experience.\n\nThat, after all, was always the selling point of Cloud Foundry. Developers stick to a few rules and, in return, they can easily push their apps to Cloud Foundry with a single command (“cf push”) and know that it will run, while the enterprises that employ them get the benefits of faster development cycles.\n\nOn the flip side, though, actually managing that Cloud Foundry install was never easy, and required either a heavy lift from internal infrastructure teams or the help of outside firms like Pivotal, IBM, SAP, Suse and others to run and manage the platform. That pretty much excluded smaller companies, and especially startups, from using the platform. As Childers noted, some still did use it, but that was never the project’s focus.\n\nNow, with the Kubernetes underpinnings in place, he believes that it will become easier for non-enterprise users to also get started with the platform. And projects like KubeCF and CF for K8s now offers a full Cloud Foundry distribution for Kubernetes, which makes it relatively easy to use the platform on top of modern infrastructure.\n\nTo highlight some of these changes, the CFF today unveiled its new tutorial hub that will not just explain what Cloud Foundry is, but also feature tutorials to get started. Some of these will be hosted and written by the Foundation itself, while community members will contribute others.\n\n“Our community has created a learning hub, curated by the Cloud Foundry Foundation, of open-source tutorials for folks to learn Cloud Foundry and related cloud native technologies,” said Childers. “The hub includes an interactive hands-on lab for first-time Cloud Foundry users to experience how easy the platform makes deploying applications to Kubernetes, and is open for the community to contribute.”"}

The Jeff Bezos -founded space company chose to deliver a bid that included a space industry “dream team” of subcontractors, including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper, and its Artemis Human Landing System will use the expertise of all three.\n\nThe Blue Origin bid was one of three that ended up winning a contract form NASA, alongside SpaceX’s Starship and a human landing system developed by Dynetics working with a range of subcontractors. Blue Origin originally debuted its vision of a human lander last year, first with the unveiling of its Blue Moon craft in May, and then with the announcement of its cross-industry “national team” at IAC later in the year.\n\nNow, the company has released an animation of how its landing system will work, including Blue Moon docking with a transfer element to bring astronauts over from the Orion capsule that will carry them to the Moon from Earth, as well as the descent stage to actually land, and the ascent stage to take off again from the disposable lander platform and return the astronauts to their ride home.\n\nHere’s where each company is involved and what they’re contributing to what you see above: Blue Origin is building the lander proper, which is that platform with legs you see first in the video, and which is left behind on the Moon at the end. Lockheed Martin is building the bubble-like vehicle that attaches to the lander, and which takes off from it at the end. Northrop Grumman is building the long cylinder that connects up with the lander and provides its propulsion through low lunar orbit as it readies to land, and then disconnects before the actual descent. Draper is behind the senses across all of this, delivering avionics for flight control and the landing itself.\n\nAs mentioned, Blue Origin is one of three companies selected by NASA to develop these lander systems, but its team brings to the table a lot of combined expertise in spaceflight and spacecraft development. The launch system itself will arrive separately from the astronauts on board Orion, making the trip either via a New Glenn rocket built by Blue Origin, which is still in development, or via the United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan, another in-development spacecraft set to take off for the first time next year."}

The key to building a positive community is allowing members to speak and be heard and, subsequently, be provided for as they contribute. The same rules apply to building a business on the concept of community, and this foundation doesn’t suddenly change during a pandemic. Sure, the needs fluctuate (as do the funds), but voicing the need — hearing them and attempting to accommodate them — should not.\n\nThe world is collectively shifting during the COVID-19 pandemic. The demand for community is arguably greater, as shelter-in-place directives have resulted in extreme isolation for some. And while these extraordinary circumstances have seen some purveyors of community step up, others have unfortunately fallen short and instead haphazardly execute “community” as a talking point rather than a reality that benefits … communities.\n\nCo-working places and social clubs like SoHo House, WeWork, The Wing and New York’s Ethel’s Club hawk community to small businesses and entrepreneurs by bringing loosely like-minded people or those with similar lifestyles into the same space.\n\nBrick-and-mortar retailers like Nike’s Live locations have leveraged localized data to bring specific communities back out to shop in-store. Shopify’s Los Angeles location’s initiative is to foster community by offering educational programming and other resources within their permanent physical space. Both brands saw the value in organizing communities and adopted the concept to further their core business.\n\nEven before COVID-19 upended everyday life, cracks in the business of community began to hurt beloved brands, as pulling the curtain back revealed unethical treatment of team members and work environments unaligned with their outward-facing brand or company mission.\n\nFitness brand and inclusive community Outdoor Voices’s “smoke and mirrors” utopia came crumbling down when 14 employees anonymously shared with BuzzFeed News stories of verbal abuse and a real life “Mean Girls” office environment.\n\nAs we persevere through this pandemic under an administration built on divisiveness, community is becoming increasingly important.\n\nThe Wing’s downfall came when 26 employees shared with The New York Times stories of racism, virtue-signaling inclusivity and white-washed feminism. Seemingly, their motto “empowering women through community” was intended for a smaller set of women than their PR and marketing let hopeful members believe, despite each employee also being a card-carrying “Winglet.”\n\nAnd WeWork has been bleeding employees, investors and direction in the wake of Adam Neumann’s exaggerated investment in himself, such as when he personally trademarked the word “We” and subsequently net $5.9 million when WeWork was renamed We Co.\n\nSince early March 2020, when we saw the shutdown of major sport events, the cancellation of conferences like CES and the postponing of festivals like Coachella, we’ve also seen these offenders continually fail their community with a lack of communication and foresight resulting in acts of desperation over safety in the face of coronavirus.\n\nDespite Neumann’s exit from WeWork in fall of 2019, company culture doesn’t change overnight, and their shaky idea of community persisted as the U.S. declared a state of emergency. WeWork opted to stay open despite shelter-in-place orders in cities with their largest locations, offering renters slashed rates and even incentivizing employees to come in with a $100 daily bonus, according to an internal memo received by The New York Times.\n\nA number of The Wing’s staff learned of the layoffs via this story on Vice that went up at 11:19 am EST on the day employees were supposed to be informed by 6:00 pm EST. SoHo House members shared that the club took until March 27 to allow members who requested it to pause memberships (which wouldn’t start until June 1), offering promises of complimentary food and drink until then.\n\nThe glaring disconnect in these self-appointed authorities of community is the lack of care for the people that contribute to the community’s foundation and convenience-based investment in its members.\n\n“I have a problem with these companies that tend to talk about it when it’s convenient, when it’s okay for everyone to do it,” Alege shared. Some will argue that it’s for the better of the business, but that argument says more about the claimant than circumstance, as there are communities and businesses that are stepping up in this time of need.\n\n“Whether or not information is provided is where I feel like you can see the differences in a company’s mission,” Alege points out. He goes on to say companies that communicated to their teams and had everyone on board in preparation for an impending recession, or actively started to take precautions as the virus spread through other areas first, inherently care more for their teams and community, even if and when layoffs happen.\n\nBrooklyn’s Ethel’s Club is the first private social and wellness club created intentionally for people of color with priority of their identity and experiences. On March 13, the club announced the precautionary shutdown of their HQ in anticipation for COVID-19.\n\nUpon making the decision, Ethel’s Club founder and owner Naj Austin said she took a lap around the club and asked some members their thoughts and what they’d like to see from Ethel’s Club should they shut down the space for a month or so.\n\n“They were like, ‘Oh, it’d be really cool if we could still have the community, somehow. Can you do it online?’ In my head, I’m thinking we have no capacity for this, but I guess we’re going to have to figure it out,” Austin added. “In exactly the same way that Ethel’s Club was started — by talking to our customers about what they wanted to see out of it — we used the same formula. It very much felt like we were starting the company all over again.”\n\nGiving herself and her team a deadline of five days, they decided to pause the 225 members’ dues and open up a digital membership nationally for $17 a month. They’ve added more than 300 digital-only members to the existing members.\n\nThe new digital membership still focuses on social and purposeful wellness. “In the morning we have programming that’s meant to intentionally address how you start your day, so super uplifting, assuming that you open your phone and read the news first thing. How can we combat that? How can we make your day successful?” Austin said.\n\nStrategically timed sessions include topics like “Radical Self Care For Radical Times,” full body at-home workouts and writing workshops, with the final session of each evening being loosely focused on celebrating the day. “When we’re in the new normal, I think people will still need this. I think people need the structure in this new world as people work from home more and just for whatever’s going to be on the other side.” Austin says this is to give members something to depend on, in this time where that is lacking.\n\nThe key to community is allowing members to speak and be heard and subsequently be provided for as they contribute.\n\nThey also launched their digital clubhouse, an Ethel’s Club members-only directory and portal for members to communicate.\n\nA community-based business model adopted by existing brands should be offering tools to foster the community. Communities formed on Instagram, Twitter and Slack have simply transformed without disappearing.\n\nIG Live has brought a plethora of wellness professionals live streaming — offering workouts to meditation — and resulted in legendary music producers Swizz Beatz and Timbaland bringing other recording artists together. This has resulted in the likes of T-Pain versus Lil’ Jon and Teddy Riley and Babyface going head to head and playing through their hits, as other musicians, producers and fans converse in the comments.\n\nAnimal Crossing has seemingly established itself among these platforms as well, offering a place for existing communities to congregate despite being unable to be physically in the same room.\n\nNew York-based DJ, Jubilee shared what the game has offered in this time, where she won’t be internationally touring for gigs like she normally does. “Yesterday I did a photo shoot with my DJ friend Teki Latex that lives in Paris. He had a bunch of us over at 10 pm his time. He even styled some of us and he got a photographer. It was so ridiculous, but it was also really fun and cute.”\n\nWith such uncertainty around when she will see her worldwide community, it seems Animal Crossing has allowed space for Jubilee and other creatives to still socialize, collaborate and have some variety in their creative output.\n\nDespite mounting privacy issues, Zoom has offered the quickest fix for those still working, while no-invite-necessary Houseparty offers video conferencing plus games for users to play together.\n\nCommunity-less platforms (and their users) like Netflix have benefited in this time of desperate need for community via the Netflix Party Chrome plug-in, which allows people to watch Netflix programming together from different locations.\n\nMeanwhile, Venmo has been watching what’s transpired on their platform and started to send money to people who have been using Venmo for good. A quick search of #venmoitforward will show Venmo sending $20 to people who are pouring into their community, whether it’s sending money to healthcare workers for lunch or extra cash to musicians and DJs live streaming their performances.\n\nAs we persevere through this pandemic under an administration built on divisiveness, community is becoming increasingly important, as a slow response from federal leadership has left a lot of additional responsibilities on local governments and essential workers. Whether you’re keeping it among your established community or participating or building new ones, doing your part can be as simple as staying home, and now more than ever, with access to the internet, you can find some sense of community."}

The offering would be attractive to companies that make baked goods or protein powder, and thus use lots of egg whites as part of their creation process.\n\nThe startup is selling a whey or dairy protein replacement, and is still working on FDA approval.\n\n“We are firm believers that whatever is in nature should be sufficient to provide humanity the ingredients they need,” said Martens from the office trailer.\n\nThe startup recently did a series of trials with companies, and Martens says that Plantible validated it can be a replacement with baking ingredient companies and plant-based meat sellers. But the startup is not limited to current use cases.\n\n“If the sector we had our eyes on is taking a while, but sports nutrition is taking off really fast, we’ll go there,” said Martens. “We need to prove the feasibility of our company.”\n\nPlantible is entering a crowded space. Recently, aquafaba, the liquid made from a can of chickpeas, has regained popularity amid other quarantine cooking hacks. Martens says that aquafaba might recreate foaminess, but it doesn’t recreate gelation (or the sizzle and fry look that comes when you pour a real egg white into a hot pan). Plantible claims to offer an egg-white replacement with no compromises on texture or nutrition.\n\nThe startup also has some increasingly well-funded alternative protein competitors. Plantible’s closest venture-backed competitors are Clara Foods and FUMI Ingredients, as both try to create egg-white replacements. Clara Foods uses yeast, instead of chickens, to make egg whites, and similarly sells to businesses that use egg whites in large quantities for items like macaroons, angel food cake and protein powders. It has the backing of Ingredion, a global ingredients solution company.\n\nPlantible needs to have a faster, cheaper and more scalable operation to beat its competitors. From a supply perspective, Plantible is in a good place. Duckweed doubles in mass every 48 hours and grows year-round. Plus, it is more digestible than pea, soy or algae, the company claims.\n\nThe real expense comes from the extraction process.\n\nRight now, Martens admits, Plantible is “lab scale, and lab scale is really expensive.”\n\nTo bring costs down, the company just raised a $4.6 million seed round, co-led by Vectr Ventures and Lerer Hippeau. Other participants include eighteen94 Capital (Kellogg Company’s venture capital fund) and FTW Ventures.\n\nThrough the new capital, Plantible claims it will be cost-competitive with egg whites. Currently, two pounds of liquid egg whites cost $8 to $10 dollars to make and sell for $15 to $20 dollars.\n\n“In the end it is about developing a scalable and cost-competitive supply chain that produces a desired ingredient. Since it is very hard to compete with nature, we have decided to embrace it as much as possible by identifying a highly functional and nutritional enzyme,” he said.\n\n“The more you can leverage nature, the more scalable you become,” he said.\n\nAs with any seed-stage alternative-protein company, the proof that Plantible has legs to succeed will be in sales and capacity to produce. And it’s not quite there yet."}

But don’t worry – Lyft is still moving forward in Oakland, and is here to help you get to where you need to go during this time.”\n\nLyft has also permanently shut down its operations in Austin and San Jose. The decision to shut down permanently in Austin came after Lyft temporarily removed the scooters in mid-March and then brought them back in early April to better serve essential workers.\n\nMoving forward, Lyft scooters will only be available in Denver, Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Monica and Washington, D.C., according to the company’s site. Right now, Lyft’s operations in Miami are still paused.\n\nLyft is not the only scooter operator that has been affected during the pandemic. Lime and Bird, for example, have both paused operations in certain markets. Bird has also similarly faced financial troubles during these times. In March, Bird laid off about 30% of its workforce.\n\nBut even before the pandemic, Lyft had ceased scooter operations in a number of cities. In November, for example, Lyft ended its operations in Nashville, San Antonio, Atlanta, the Phoenix area, Dallas and Columbus. At the time, Lyft also laid off 20 employees."}

The key to successful gardening is projects that have high success rates and cost less than their store-bought versions.\n\nAD\n\nHere are eight of them:\n\nBerries: Have you seen what raspberries cost? It’s $3.99 for a teeny flat of a fruit that grows like a weed. Why they are not planted in everybody’s yard is inexplicable. Blackberries, too, although I am not their biggest fan. (They are my husband’s favorite fruit, which mystifies me.) There are also blueberries and strawberries, and a whole second string of less popular players: gooseberries, boysenberries, huckleberries, et al. I’m going to throw beach plums in here, because sandy soil that won’t grow much else, with which I have extensive experience, will suit beach plums just fine. And you will have jelly.\n\nAD\n\nThe big problem is keeping the varmints from eating your harvest. One year, we threw a net over a big highbush blueberry plant, and a bird got caught inside, with nothing to eat but blueberries.\n\nAD\n\nPerennial vegetables: You gotta love a vegetable that comes up of its own accord, year after year. Plant once, eat forever. The problem is that the “perennial vegetables” category is small.\n\nThe king, of course, is asparagus. Most of the time, it goes for $3 a pound, give or take. If you plant it this year, you will recoup your investment hundreds of times over.\n\nIn parts of the country with mild winters, you can also grow artichokes, probably the second-best perennial. And if artichoke makes you think of Jerusalem artichokes, don’t even bother. They are unrelated to artichokes and not from Jerusalem. Their real name is “sunchoke,” and they only have a fancy-pants name because some PR person wanted to convince you that they are delicious when in reality they are a key member of the the Jicama/Water-chestnut/Sunchoke Axis of Insipidity. We fed ours to our pigs, and even they didn’t like them very much.\n\nPlant rhubarb instead. Not because it’ll save you money, but because it comes up early and reliably, has attractive giant leaves, and goes well with your strawberries.\n\nHerbs: Not only are herbs expensive, they never come in the quantities you want. Your recipe calls for a handful of parsley, but it only comes in bushels. Or your pesto requires a bushel of basil and it comes by the thimbleful, each $2.99.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn herb garden, where you can go out and snip just the amount you need, will save you money and also reduce your herb waste. Make sure you hit the perennials: Sage, thyme, tarragon, mint and oregano all come up year after year (although my tarragon is fussy and doesn’t seem to like the conditions at my house).\n\nAlso, if you cook anything, ever, and you don’t have a rosemary bush, you’re out of your mind. Nobody should ever buy rosemary.\n\nMushrooms: This one’s a little off the beaten path, but it’s worth it.\n\nI’m not gonna lie: You have to cut down a tree — or otherwise get access to some hardwood logs. But stick with me here. Shiitake mushrooms can run $12 a pound, but if you invest $45 in mycelium-infused plugs (I get mine from Fungi Perfecti), and do a bit of work, you’ll have recurring mushroom flushes for the next five years or so. Maybe longer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll you have to do is drill shallow holes in the logs and hammer home one plug in each hole. Seal it with wax, and you’re done. You probably have to wait at least a year for the first flush (it takes a while for the mycelium, that white fibrous material that mushrooms sprout out of, to colonize the logs). But after that, they’ll appear regularly, particularly after a rain. (You can even force a flush by soaking the logs.) The mushrooms are big and beefy, and when you make soup, you will thank me.\n\nIf you want mushrooms but happen not to have power tools or a tree to cut down, you can buy complete kits to grow them on a smaller scale (from suppliers like Field & Forest). They won’t be a win, price-wise, but the fascination factor is pretty high.\n\nLeeks and garlic: The effort involved is minuscule. Drop a bunch of seeds (in the case of leeks) or garlic cloves in the ground and wait. They’re not fast growers; garlic is an over-winter crop where I live, and leeks take all season. But they make up for it by requiring no effort at all. Bonus: The pungent flavors that we like so much are off-putting to insects, so you’re unlikely to have pest problems.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTomatoes: In season, the good ones can go for $5 a pound. If you grow any standard-issue garden veg (or veg-like fruit, in this case), this is the one. Eggplant, collard greens and broccoli don’t usually get to the $5 per pound level, and it’s a good bet that the ones you grow aren’t any better than the ones in the supermarket (don’t @ me). But your tomatoes will be delicious, so that’s where you should put your energy. Try those little sungolds or other candy-flavored cherry tomatoes, but plant some big ones, too. Your BLT will never be the same.\n\nTrees: Money doesn’t actually grow on trees, but fruits and nuts do, and that’s almost as good.\n\nIf you like figs and live in a place where a fig tree would survive, you must plant one. You can almost never get fresh figs otherwise (they’re extremely perishable), and when you can, they cost the moon. I live in a place where a fig tree can almost survive, and we’ve been keeping one going for a decade now. Some years, it dies back to the roots, but at its peak, we get an easy hundred figs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf you’re in colder climes, try an Asian pear tree. In many places, pests don’t seem to have cottoned on to the deliciousness of Asian pears, and they’re not nearly as vulnerable to insects as apples or pears.\n\nIf you can grow pecans or hazelnuts, it’s one of the biggest winners in the garden. A mature pecan tree can produce 40 pounds of pecans. Every year, probably for your lifetime. We won’t talk about the rarefied world of citrus, mangoes and avocados because so few of us live in places where they grow, but, wherever you are, there’s a fruit-bearing tree for you.\n\nForaged foods: Foraging is the ultimate DIY food. Plants, out in the wild, free for the taking. But if you’re new to it, you should know the hard truth: While many wild plants are edible, few are delicious. Oh, sure, the foragerati will tell you that, really, there’s nothing better than a purslane salad. But when you try it, you will find out that purslane tastes like grass clippings. (Don’t get my editor here started on fiddlehead ferns.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are, however, a few real wins. The first ones out in the spring are ramps and wild onions. It’s not that wild onions are vastly superior to ordinary onions, but they come up just as the weather gets nice, and they’re everywhere.\n\nRaspberries and blackberries grow in large swaths of the country, in unruly patches that are the bane of landscapers. Unlike so many other wild foods, these are often as good as the store-bought version. Send the kids out for them, and they’ll come back with seven berries, full stomachs and indelible stains.\n\nThe absolute best foraging finds, though, are the mushrooms. I get why people shy away from them — the upside is a tasty side dish and the downside is an excruciating death. But a handful are easy to ID and are better than anything you can buy: chanterelles, black trumpets, chicken-of-the-woods, hen-of-the-woods (different from chicken-of-the-woods, go figure) and a variety of boletes, which have pores instead of gills. Do not take any tall, skinny mushrooms with gills unless your mycological skills are ninja-level.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDo try this at home. Before you knew me as a mild-mannered food columnist, my husband, Kevin, and I spent a decade DIY-ing food of every kind. Gardens, sure, but also chickens, turkeys and pigs. We fish, we hunt, we forage. We’ve experimented with hydroponics, we’ve grown mushrooms, we’ve made our own sea salt. We know the heartbreak that is beekeeping.\n\nWe didn’t do it for ideological reasons; Kevin and I are staunch advocates of interdependence. We did it because it was interesting. And it has shifted our perception. We never forget that food has to come from somewhere. Someone has to plant the plants, tend them, harvest them. Meat doesn’t happen unless an animal lives and dies. All foods have a cost, all foods make an impact, and our experience has made us very aware of, and careful about, our foods’ provenance.\n\nI am persuaded that some of the problems in our food system — on both the production and consumption sides — stem from the fact that eaters are far removed from their food’s source. This virus has disrupted the food system that got us there, and maybe something as simple as planting a seed in a pot can be the first tiny step to rebuilding that system differently.\n\nAD"}

The police complaint, she said, was filed \"for safety reasons only\" as the statute of limitations for her claim had expired.\n\nMr Biden is running against Republican incumbent President Donald Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by some 25 women.\n\nThe Democrat put out his statement before speaking on Morning Joe, a show on US cable channel MSNBC.\n\nWhat are Reade's accusations?\n\nShe was working as a staff assistant to Mr Biden from 1992-93, when he was a senator for the US state of Delaware.\n\nMs Reade, now 56, says that in 1993 he forced her up against a wall in the halls of Congress, and put his hands under her shirt and skirt, penetrating her with a finger.\n\n\"I remember him saying, first, as he was doing it 'Do you want to go somewhere else?' and then him saying to me, when I pulled away... he said 'Come on man, I heard you liked me,'\" she told podcast host Katie Halper in March. \"That phrase stayed with me.\"\n\nImage copyright Scott Olson Image caption The allegations may also complicate the process of finding a running mate for Mr Biden, especially for top female Democrats\n\nMs Reade says records of Mr Biden's 36-year career as a US senator will contain evidence that she complained to her superiors about him.\n\nThe records are being held at the University of Delaware, which has said it will not release any papers until two years after Mr Biden leaves public life.\n\nIt appears there were no witnesses to the alleged assault but three people have backed Ms Reade's account.\n\nHer brother, a former neighbour and a former colleague have all said that they heard her give it shortly after the alleged incident.\n\nFormer neighbour Lynda LaCasse told Business Insider: \"This happened, and I know it did because I remember talking about it.\"\n\n\"I remember her saying, here was this person that she was working for and she idolised him,\" Ms LaCasse said. \"I remember the skirt. I remember the fingers. I remember she was devastated.\"\n\nMs Reade is one of more than half a dozen women who have forward over the last year to accuse him of inappropriate touching, hugging or kissing, though none described his actions as sexual assault at the time.\n\nWhat did Biden say?\n\nSpeaking to MSNBC's Mika Brezezinski on Friday, the former vice-president denied any sexual misconduct against Tara Reade outright.\n\n\"It did not happen. Period,\" he said.\n\nBrezezinski pressed Mr Biden on his former statements suggesting that women should be believed when coming forward with their stories of sexual violence.\n\nIn 2018, when now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford, Mr Biden was joined by a chorus of top Democrats in supporting Dr Ford's claims, and insisting that she be heard.\n\n\"For a woman to come forward in the glaring light of focus, nationally, you've got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she's talking about is real, whether or not she forgets the facts, whether or not it's been made worse or better over time,\" Mr Biden told reporters at the time.\n\n\"Are women to be believed unless it pertains to you?\" Brezezinski asked Mr Biden on Friday.\n\n\"Women are to be believed, given the benefit of the doubt,\" Mr Biden said. \"Then you have to look at the circumstances and the facts.\"\n\n\"The truth matters.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Lucy Flores is one of several woman who has accused Biden of of inappropriate behaviour\n\nMr Biden refused to speculate on Ms Reade's motives, saying she had a right to come forward \"and say whatever she wants to say. But I have a right to say: 'Look at the facts.'\"\n\nBut the former vice-president would not move to open his files at the University of Delaware for a search of documents pertaining to Ms Reade. Despite repeated questioning from Brezezinski, Mr Biden insisted those 1,800 boxes of documents did not contain any personnel files and would be used as political \"fodder\" for his ongoing presidential campaign.\n\nStanding by Their Man\n\nAnalysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter\n\nAs Joe Biden faces a serious sexual assault accusation, Democrats face a problem.\n\nThey are trying to be the political party that champions women and survivors of sexual assault, and yet their 2020 presidential candidate-apparent himself has been caught up in controversy over how he treats women.\n\nThough Mr Biden has insisted that the allegation that he assaulted his former staff assistant Tara Reade 27 years ago is \"unequivocally\" false, he - and his Democratic supporters - are finding it hard to avoid the accusation that there is a whiff of hypocrisy over the whole affair.\n\nConservatives have pointed out the relative silence over Ms Reade's allegation compared to the outcry over sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's most recent Supreme Court appointment.\n\nIn September 2018, while the Kavanaugh hearing was unfolding, Ford's name came up 1,898 times on CNN and nearly as often on MSNBC, according to RealClearPolitics.\n\nUntil recently, however, Ms Reade's name was barely mentioned.\n\nMr Biden himself said Ms Ford and other women who come forward with sexual assault claims should be presumed to be telling the truth. He is having trouble answering questions now over why it should not the case with Ms Reade.\n\nThat has posed a particular problem for senior Democratic women backing Mr Biden - some of whom are being whispered as possible names for the Biden 2020 ticket.\n\nThe senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams are said to be among those hoping to become his vice-presidential candidate.\n\nBut with the sexual misconduct claims, an offer from Biden will be a \"poisoned chalice\", says Rebecca Traister in New York Magazine: Once one of these women accepts his offer and runs as his vice-presidential candidate, they will be tied to Biden's \"historical shortcomings\" and could imperil themselves and their own political future. It is a fine mess for progressive women to fall into, with no easy way out.\n\nCould the allegations hurt Biden's election chances?\n\nSome Republicans are seizing on the Reade allegations to portray the Democrats as hypocrites who only defend women who allege wrongdoing against conservatives, the Associated Press reports.\n\nPresident Trump's campaign derided Mr Biden's interview. The Democrat \"once again demonstrated that he believes he should be held to a different standard than he has set for others\" a Trump campaign spokeswoman said.\n\nBut given the long-standing allegations against Donald Trump, a man who once boasted of grabbing women by the genitals, the Republican camp may struggle to make political capital from Mr Biden's troubles.\n\nAt the same time, the Democrats have set themselves up as the party of moral purity, on gender as well as race. The party's politicians are inevitably held to a different standard.\n\nAnd women are a core constituency for the party, traditionally giving more votes to Democratic candidates than Republicans."}

What's the US strategy?\n\nThis week President Donald J Trump turned a corner with his 2020 re-election campaign.\n\n\"China will do anything they can to have me lose this race,\" he told the Reuters news agency.\n\nHis sharpening rhetoric against Beijing marked a new phase in an effort to reframe an election that's been reshaped by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAnd it signalled rockier times for the already rocky relationship between the world's two biggest economies.\n\nThe Trump campaign had planned to make America's booming economy its centrepiece, but that has tanked. And polls show decreasing support for the president in key battleground states amidst criticism of his corona crisis performance.\n\nEnter China, the origin of the pandemic and accused of acting too slowly to stop its global spread\n\nThe Republican strategy actually attacks the former vice president, Joe Biden, the presumed Democratic nominee.\n\nMr Trump's allies in the America First Action (AFA) political committee have been rolling out advertisements lashing \"Beijing Biden\" for \"leading the charge\" of a Washington elite too willing to accommodate a predatory China.\n\nMr Biden has hit back with an advert that accuses the president of trying to deflect blame for his own slow response to the pandemic, and of being too trusting of China's initial information about the virus.\n\nThe common element in these starkly different positions is that both campaigns believe it's good politics to argue their man will be strongest in taking on Beijing.\n\n\"If you look at the most recent Pew poll and Gallup poll, Americans' distrust of China, whether you're Republican or Democrat, is at an all-time high,\" roughly two-thirds of the country, says the AFA's Kelly Sadler. \"This is a universal issue that Republicans and Democrats can both agree on.\"\n\nThere's certainly been a dramatic uptick in negative views of China since Mr Trump took office and dialled up the trade war.\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption A billboard in Shenyang, China\n\nWhen it comes to Beijing's culpability for the corona crisis, however, he has regularly wavered, at times lavishing praise on President Xi Jinping, at times lashing the \"Chinese Virus.\" But he's now started to adopt the hardline campaign-speak, vowing to make China pay for the damage.\n\nThe aggressive rhetoric builds on a growing fury in the administration and amongst multiple lawmakers at the Chinese government's lack of transparency about a virus that has brought global disaster.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has been out front on this. He regularly declares that the Chinese communist party can't be trusted. He focuses attention on Beijing's inability to contain the virus shortly after it emerged, and questions the security of its laboratories, all charges that China vigorously denies.\n\nThere are concerns about China's behaviour across the political spectrum, says Michael Green, who was an Asia advisor for President George W Bush. But members of Mr Trump's national security team have \"a very zero sum view of relations with China and are particularly focused on preventing China from getting any advantage out of any situation.\"\n\nPresident Xi Jinping's playbook is also \"much more aggressive\" than his predecessors,\" says Mr Green, noting a robust Chinese propaganda campaign that's even suggested the virus came from the US military. \"There's a zero sum ideological and geopolitical spin on the ball coming out of China that predates Donald Trump.\"\n\nBut that nationalist authoritarian turn has clashed with the Trump administration's America First nationalism, increasing confrontation and preventing the kind of cooperation that could combat the pandemic and prevent a new one.\n\nMr Green notes that before President Trump took office there were more than two dozen American and Chinese staff experts from the Center for Disease Control \"working these issues\" in Beijing. When the crisis broke out there were three or four, although he says both governments are to blame for that.\n\nThe national security experts are countered by the \"New York globalists\" in Mr Trump's inner circle, who argue that the United States needs China for business and trade.\n\n\"The relationship between China and the United States is going to be very uneven going forward,\" says Gary Locke, a Chinese American who was President Barack Obama's ambassador to Beijing. \"It will be antagonistic at one level, but also seeking great cooperation on…the economic front, because so many American farmers depend on China (to buy) what they produce.\"\n\nAs the election approaches Mr Trump has signalled that he will listen more to the hawks than the doves in his coterie of conflicted advisors. And he'll be cheered on by a number of Republican lawmakers who've been pushing the administration to stand up to China.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How Trump's attitude toward coronavirus has shifted\n\nSeveral have introduced legislation or floated ideas that would punish Beijing for concealing or distorting information about the coronavirus. The states of Missouri and Mississippi have taken the unprecedented step of suing for damages.\n\nAnd the party's fiercest China critic, Senator Tom Cotton, has gone to the extreme of accusing the Chinese government of deliberately allowing the virus to escape it's borders, \"because if they were going to suffer an economic contraction they were not going to allow the world to continue to prosper.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The world is watching, and hoping its two superpowers resolve their differences\n\nBut his call to bring supply lines back to the United States will have bipartisan resonance as the pandemic has focused glaring attention on America's dependence on China for drugs and medical equipment.\n\nCrucially, there's concern that the anti-China rhetoric is reinforcing an atmosphere of xenophobia already growing because of the pandemic, resulting in an increase of verbal and physical attacks on Asian Americans.\n\n\"Just because I'm Chinese American doesn't mean that I'm a Chinese government official,\" Gary Locke noted wryly of his unexpected appearance in the Trump campaign's advert bashing Joe Biden. Mr Biden's team has also been criticised on the left for \"out-Trumping Trump\" rather than challenging a \"racist nationalistic\" conversation.\n\nBoth campaigns have denied stoking xenophobia.

Their ballots will show who they blame."}

Close to 230,000 have died.\n\nThere are only a handful of countries that haven't been touched by the pandemic.\n\nOn Thursday, we told you about the lives of seven people in the UK who died on 12 April, the day the country officially surpassed 10,000 hospital deaths.\n\nThese are the stories of four other deaths on three continents that also happened that day.\n\nMaria Pollidori was admitted to hospital in central Italy in late February for a stomach cancer operation. Everything seemed to have gone smoothly, and her family looked forward to her return.\n\nBut on 9 April they received a call from the hospital saying the 84 year old had tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nItaly is at the epicentre of the global pandemic, recording more coronavirus-related deaths than any other country in the world. The central region of Marche, where Maria and her family live, has recorded thousands of cases.\n\nBut Maria's family had no idea that she had been showing any symptoms.\n\nThree days after they received the call from the hospital, she passed away.\n\nImage copyright Photo supplied\n\nHer son Pierluigi said the hardest thing was not being able to be close to her \"at the time she needed us most\".\n\nMaria's death was not only felt by her family. As a nurse and midwife of 25 years she was well known in and around the small seaside town of Porto Potenza.\n\nBut because of the pandemic, no-one was able to pay their respects to her at a funeral.\n\nIt is a story that echoes throughout the country.\n\nThousands of miles away in the US state of Texas, Phillip Tsai-Brooks and his husband Anthony were both in hospital with Covid-19 on 12 April.\n\nIt was love at first sight when the pair were introduced through mutual friends.\n\nThey married in 2014 on a cruise ship in San Francisco Bay, and brought Phillip's widowed mother on their honeymoon to Puerto Rico - as they often did on their much-loved international travels.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, Phillip's brothers said Phillip and Anthony were able to break barriers, and were accepted as a couple in the city of San Antonio, where they were known for the joy they brought to people's lives.\n\nImage copyright Photo supplied\n\nPhillip, one of five brothers, had always dreamed of being a hair stylist and one day opening his own salon. His ambitions were realised when he opened the Extreme Opulence Hair Studio. More recently, he had been teaching others in the profession.\n\nOnly child Anthony, known as Tony, spent several years in the US Air Force before working for his local council, helping with budget planning for the city of Live Oak.\n\nA colleague said he was \"smarter about city budgets than most people\", and described him as \"one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet\".\n\nThe charismatic military veteran would regularly bring sweets into work for the local mayor, dropping them in a jar on her desk, he said.\n\nRelatives and friends of the men described them as the perfect couple. They dreamed of one day adopting their own children.\n\nBut their lives and dreams were tragically interrupted by the outbreak of coronavirus.\n\nIn a Facebook post in late March, 42-year-old Phillip said he was feeling unwell and had been told to quarantine as a precaution.\n\nSix days later, he said he was in hospital with confirmed coronavirus.\n\n\"Be here for a couple of days… then quarantine,\" he wrote.\n\nAnthony, 52, was taken to a different hospital, suffering similar symptoms.\n\nIn what Phillip's brothers described as the final chapter of their love story, Tony was moved from another healthcare system into the same hospital as Phillip. As their conditions deteriorated, they lay in rooms next to each other.\n\nPhillip passed away on 12 April after suffering a heart attack as a complication of Covid-19. Just two days later, Anthony died.\n\n\"Such a tragic loss but their love will last forever,\" Phillip's brothers said.\n\nElsewhere in North America, Victor Batista Falla had recently returned to Cuba, the country of his birth, for the first time in 60 years.\n\nThe 87 year old was born into one of the wealthiest families in the country, with his father's side founding a bank and his mother descending from rich sugar planters.\n\nHe fled the country in 1960, after Fidel Castro and his revolutionary forces ousted President Fulgencio Batista.\n\nVictor then became a prominent figure of Cuban exile literature, founding the journals Exilio and Escandalar in New York.\n\nImage copyright Handout\n\nAfter moving to Madrid, he opened the publishing house Colibrí, through which he published numerous essays about Cuba.\n\nFrance-based Cuban writer William Navarrete met Victor in the Spanish capital in 1996 at a cafe popular with Cuban exiles. After their first meeting, the pair saw each other whenever William was in Madrid.\n\nWilliam described Victor as a man who hated confrontation and gossip, and who was protective of his privacy.\n\n\"He was a bon vivant, but very measured,\" William said of his friend.\n\n\"He never ostentatiously displayed relationships and never boasted about the things he did.\"\n\nVictor's high-profile relationships extended far beyond Cuba. He was the uncle of the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and a statement from the duke and duchess said his death was a \"great loss\" for the family.\n\nWilliam said Victor never spoke of his connection to the royals and did not like to talk about his family's vast wealth.\n\n\"Once I asked him if he was nostalgic for the lavish life he had had in Cuba until the age of 27,\" William recalled. \"He replied that he was nostalgic for the things he wanted to do and that he had not done.\"\n\nAfter 60 years away from the country, Victor quietly returned to Cuba in February. It's not clear what led him to return.\n\nWilliam did not know anything of the trip until he read a newspaper article telling him that his friend had died there of Covid-19.\n\nIn the early hours of 3 December, 1984, a valve broke in a storage tank inside a chemical factory in the central Indian city of Bhopal.\n\nSoon after, a deadly cloud of gas escaped from the factory into the surrounding neighbourhoods. It became one of the deadliest industrial disasters in modern history. Thousands of people died, and tens of thousands more needed treatment.\n\nAmong them was Imran Khan, who was just a young boy when the disaster happened. Two years ago, he developed mouth cancer, believed to be a result of the leak, and had to give up work.\n\nAfter surviving his initial cancer, it returned again, and he was forced to undergo more chemotherapy.\n\nHis condition deteriorated in recent weeks and he died on 12 April. Later tests confirmed that he had contracted coronavirus.\n\nA group representing survivors of the gas tragedy have accused the local government of turning their backs on people like Imran.\n\nThey say five gas leak survivors died of coronavirus within days of each other.\n\nA hospital set up for gas victims was converted into a facility for coronavirus patients. The Bhopal Group for Information and Action says gas victims were then ignored, despite being particularly vulnerable to the virus because of their health conditions.\n\nImran's older brother Rashid Khan is now looking after his wife and son.\n\n\"The wellbeing of his entire family is on my shoulders,\" he told BBC Hindi.\n\nAdditional reporting by Alessandra Maggiorani and Shuriah Niazi"}

Her lawyers said the ruling did not change \"the core elements of this case\".\n\nWhat happened at the ruling?\n\nAt a hearing held remotely last week, Associated Newspapers - the publishers of the Mail on Sunday, Daily Mail and MailOnline - asked for parts of Meghan's case to be dismissed.\n\nJudge Mr Justice Warby agreed and on Friday struck out parts of Meghan's claim, including her allegations the publisher acted \"dishonestly\" by leaving out certain parts of the letter.\n\nHe also dismissed Meghan's allegations that the publisher deliberately \"dug up\" issues between Meghan and her father, and that it had an \"agenda\" of publishing intrusive or offensive stories about her.\n\nMr Justice Warby said the allegations he struck out do not go to the \"heart of the case\", and that they may be brought back at a later stage if they are put on a proper legal basis.\n\nWhat does the ruling mean?\n\nThis is a very good day for Associated Newspapers and a very bad one for the Duchess of Sussex and her legal team.\n\nIt is however, an early skirmish in what is looking like a long, expensive and brutal legal battle.\n\nThe duchess has had parts of her claim for invasion of privacy struck out. Those parts relate to allegations Associated acted with dishonesty and malice, that it deliberately \"stirred up\" issues between the duchess and her father, and that it had an agenda to paint her in a false and damaging light.\n\nActions for breach of privacy do not have to include allegations of this kind.\n\nAt trial, the case will turn on whether the duchess had a reasonable expectation that the letter written to her father would remain private and there was no overriding public interest in publishing it.\n\nMany lawyers take the view that a letter written to a relative concerning a family relationship is by definition private, no matter who the author is or what rank they hold.\n\nHowever, Associated argue that the duchess did not expect the letter to remain private, anticipated that it would be published, and that publication was in the public interest. The battle is far from over.\n\nWhat is the case about?\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Last month, Prince Harry and Meghan told the UK's tabloid press they are ending all co-operation with them\n\nMeghan is suing Associated Newspapers over five articles, two in the Mail on Sunday and three on MailOnline, which were published in February 2019.\n\nThe articles reproduced parts of a handwritten letter she sent to her father Thomas Markle, six months before in August 2018.\n\nThe headline in the Mail on Sunday carried the headline: \"Revealed: The letter showing true tragedy of Meghan's rift with a father she says has 'broken her heart into a million pieces'.\"\n\nMeghan claims the letter was \"private and confidential\" and \"detailed her intimate thoughts and feelings about her father's health and her relationship with him at that time\".\n\nShe is seeking damages for alleged misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act.\n\nAssociated Newspapers wholly denies the allegations and says it will hotly contest the case.\n\nIt argues the Duchess of Sussex had no reasonable expectation of privacy and anticipated publication of the letter.\n\nIn January, it filed its defence documents which claimed the duchess was more worried about the \"unflattering\" effect of the publication of the letter, rather than any breach of her data protection rights.\n\nHow has Meghan responded to the ruling?\n\nLawyers for Schillings, the firm representing Meghan, said the ruling did not change \"the core elements of this case\".\n\n\"The duchess's rights were violated; the legal boundaries around privacy were crossed,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThey said they respect the judge's decision and \"the strong case against Associated will continue to focus on the issue of a private, intimate and handwritten letter from a daughter to her father that was published by the Mail on Sunday\".\n\n\"This gross violation of any person's right to privacy is obvious and unlawful, and the Mail on Sunday should be held to account for their actions.\"\n\nBBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said \"lawyers who are experienced in this field are starting to wonder whether the duchess' legal advisers have 'over-egged' the case in their determination to satisfy the Sussex's longing to teach the tabloids a lesson\".\n\n\"Neither side shows any inclination to withdraw,\" said our correspondent. \"It will therefore have to be decided in the High Court at a date still to be decided.\""}

That's a bad, that's a hard question for them to answer.\"\n\nIntelligence agencies have also been tasked with determining if China and the WHO withheld information about the virus early on, unnamed officials told NBC News.\n\nWhat did the intelligence service say?\n\nIn a rare public statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees US spy agencies, said on Thursday it concurs with the \"wide scientific consensus\" regarding Covid-19's natural origins.\n\n\"The [intelligence community] will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\"\n\nIt was the first clear response from American intelligence debunking conspiracy theories - both from the US and China - that the virus is a bioweapon.\n\nWhat is the Wuhan lab?\n\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was founded in the 1950s, houses China's first Biosafety Level 4 laboratory.\n\nSuch labs handle the most dangerous pathogens for which there are few available vaccines or treatments, and one of the areas the Wuhan facility studies is coronaviruses from bats.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The foundation of the Wuhan lab boosted China's international prestige\n\nDesigned and built with French help at a cost of $44m (£35m), the lab opened in 2015. Many of its staff were trained at a similar facility in the French city of Lyon, Nature journal reports.\n\nIt is prestigious for China to have a Biosafety Level 4 lab with links to similar labs around the world.\n\nWhat are Trump's accusations against China?\n\nMr Trump has recently been escalating his war of words with China over the pandemic after what officials within the US president's administration had described as a truce with Beijing.\n\nOn Wednesday, he suggested China wanted him to lose his re-election bid in November.\n\nHe has formerly accused Chinese officials of covering up the virus early on and saying they could have stopped the disease from spreading.\n\nHe has similarly criticised the WHO and withdrawn US funding for the global body.\n\nChina's foreign ministry, meanwhile, has accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from its own problems tackling the crisis.\n\nA ministry spokesman has also repeatedly promoted the idea - without evidence - that Covid-19 might have originated in the US.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the Trump administration is looking into ways to punish China financially. Discussions reportedly include allowing the US government to sue China for damages or cancelling debt obligations.\n\nHow has Trump clashed with US intelligence before?\n\nIn January, he called US intelligence agencies \"naive\" on Iran and dismissed their assessment of the threat posed by North Korea.\n\nHis willingness to attack intelligence assessments goes back to his election in 2016, when he questioned an assessment that said Russia had interfered in the campaign.\n\nHe has continued to defend Russia against the accusation that it ran a campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories to tip the vote in his favour despite US charges brought against Russian citizens.\n\nThe right moment for this fight?\n\nPresident Trump's offensive against China is largely about domestic politics and his re-election campaign but it threatens to accentuate a developing Cold War mind-set towards Beijing which may well come to dominate diplomacy in the months and years ahead.\n\nCertainly there is much to criticise in China's handling of the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak and it has shamelessly sought to make political capital from the crisis. Even Mr Trump's Democratic opponent - Joe Biden - is doubling down on Beijing. But many analysts ask if this is the right moment to have this fight.\n\nChina's rise has not gone as many in the West hoped. In its own region it is a military superpower - a match for the mighty United States. Its technological capabilities in strategic areas like 5G and artificial intelligence are impressive. And its wider influence - fostered through a single-minded effort to develop trade ties; financial relationships and so on - means that China is a force to be reckoned with, increasingly able to influence the international rules of the game.\n\nCountering Beijing's rising role will be the next US president's central foreign policy challenge, while also trying to find ways to work with China on issues like climate change."}

All tests would be carried out by health professionals at a drive-through NHS testing facility that each club would have access to. Training grounds will be optimised for social distancing and high hygiene levels.\n\nIn addition:\n\nPlayers must arrive at training grounds in kit and wear masks at all times.\n\nThey must not shower or eat on the premises. If clubs want to provide players with food, it must be delivered as a takeaway to players' cars.\n\nOnly essential medical treatment would be allowed, with all medical staff in full PPE.\n\nAll meetings and reviews must take place virtually and off-site.\n\n'Litigation inevitable'\n\nLiverpool are 25 points clear at the top of the Premier League table\n\nLeading sports lawyer Nick de Marco told BBC Sport any decision made will need to be a \"compromise\" but \"it's inevitable there will be litigation arising from it\".\n\n\"It's impossible to reach a decision that will please everybody. The legal issues and of course the health issues are the main determining factors at the moment,\" added De Marco.\n\nHe said there are \"four big legal issues\" which would involve broadcasters, sponsors, clubs and individual players.\n\nThose could include disputes over value for money if the season is not completed, as well as disagreements over who is awarded the title, who is relegated and who is promoted.\n\n\"There's also the fundamental health problem. What if players don't feel that it's safe to return?\" he added.\n\nDe Marco also said there was a \"very big problem\" regarding player contracts as \"nothing is preventing them\" from walking out if it expires before the season is completed.\n\n\"You could have a player playing for a club one week and a rival the next week,\" he said.\n\n'Change of behaviour needed'\n\nEva Carneiro while working as Chelsea's first team doctor\n\nFormer Chelsea doctor Eva Carneiro told BBC Radio Four a \"change of behaviour\" is needed when football does return.\n\n\"I think it is possible to change the culture of the sport and it requires rigorous implementation,\" said Carneiro.\n\n\"In order to do that, you require the support of your governing body and that has historically not always been the case in football.\"\n\nCarneiro said the \"close contact of footballers\" during games, travelling and in training makes them \"so much more prone to developing infection\".\n\n\"I think there will be a lot of fear. That won't be held by the widely varying practices,\" she added.\n\n\"The evidence base for this virus is in its infancy. We know very little about it so to be able to deliver a safe return is going to be a huge challenge and I think we require time.\"\n\nCarneiro added that doctors will need training on infection control while \"rapid and effective testing\" will be \"key\" to a safe return."}

It is not known as to whether the contract in place for the fight could lapse as a result of the delays but if it did, it would free Fury to pursue his fight of choice.\n\n\"Negotiations aren't under way,\" Joshua's promoter Hearn told Sky Sports on Thursday. \"What I can tell you is we are talking. We are all on the same page. You will get this fight, it's just a case of where and when.\n\n\"There is the major hurdle that we are both under contract for other fights. Everything is solvable with money.\"\n\nDelivering the fight - which would create the first heavyweight in history to hold all four belts - faces further hurdles even if Wilder and Pulev step away from their respective bouts.\n\nPromoters Hearn and Warren would need to briefly overcome their rivalry, Fury's promoter in the US Bob Arum would need to be on board, financial splits would need agreeing and rival television broadcasters would need to work as one.\n\nA source close to the talks stressed the need for everyone involved to work in harmony, a feat that has at times been hard to achieve in securing the biggest bouts in the sport.\n\nOn his podcast, former world super-middleweight champion Carl Froch assured listeners that regardless of politics, bouts at the highest level will happen if the fighters want them.\n\n\"Trust me, the fighter at the top level is the boss,\" said Froch. \"It's the fighters that aren't making the fight happen. If two fighters actually want the fight, have a 50-50 split, remember that the fight doesn't happen without both of you, so then the fight happens.\"\n\nWhile talks are at a very early stage, any bout would be aimed at late in 2020 or early in 2021 and in the interim, all parties will learn if it would be possible for fans to attend any fight given the current ban on mass gatherings in most countries."}

[There are] many reasons for wanting to start the season.\n\n\"One is obviously to excite the fans, who have all been frustrated by the delays. We've got a very exciting season in front of us. But it's a very important livelihood for thousands of people, it's another reason for trying to kick-start the season.\"\n\nHe said that the need to ensure the sport created no added medical risk in running events was one of the issues pushing it towards its current plan to have two races at both Austria and Silverstone on consecutive weekends in July.\n\n\"It's a real consideration because one of the logistical challenges is getting everyone tested and cleared to enter the paddock and enter the racing environment,\" Brawn said.\n\n\"And I think once we do that, it's very attractive to keep everyone in that environment, within that kind of biosphere that we want to create for another race.\n\n\"It's also pretty challenging to find the right sort of races early on where we can control the environment well enough.\n\n\"Austria fits that bill very well. It's got a local airport right next to the circuit, where people can charter planes into. It's not too close to a metropolis, it has a great infrastructure around it.\n\n\"There will be no motorhomes, but there will be a full catering facility laid on that the circuit has. So we can basically contain everyone within that environment. Therefore once we're there, it's appealing to have another race the following week.\"\n\nIt is unclear to where the season would head next in Europe after the races in Austria and Silverstone.\n\nSpain and Hungary are possible next venues.\n\nThe organisers at the Hungaroring announced on Friday that it would not be possible to hold their race without fans.\n\nBBC Sport understands they are confident after conversations with the Hungarian government that the race will be able to go ahead.\n\nHungary on Thursday banned events of more than 500 people until mid-August but current talks have focused on holding the event after that date.\n\nBrawn added: \"It's been months now of working on the best reaction we can have to this terrible pandemic, the best reaction the sport and business can have.\n\n\"So my days and weeks and months have been full of negotiations with the team and [governing body] the FIA on the right way forward and of course the circumstances are changing so frequently and that's pretty challenging.

Only Blackburn (68) and Manchester United (67) scored more.\n\nTop league scorer: Ian Olney (11).\n\nOther key men: Gunnar Halle, Nick Henry, Andy Ritchie.\n\nOldham were one of the Premier League's founder members but to survive for season two they had to pull off some heroics in the final week.\n\nThe Latics faced Aston Villa, who were still in the title race, knowing they had to win their last three games - and hope Crystal Palace gained no more than a point from their last two.\n\nBut Joe Royle's side won 1-0 at Villa before beating Liverpool 3-2 in midweek. That night Palace drew at Manchester City so it went down to the final day.\n\nPalace fell behind at Arsenal while the Latics romped into a 4-1 lead over Southampton. And although the Saints made it 4-3 to set up a nervy finish, Oldham held on to stay up on goal difference.\n\nWest Brom 2004-05\n\nWest Brom became the first Premier League side to avoid relegation having been bottom on Christmas Day.\n\nTop league scorer: Robert Earnshaw (11).\n\nOther key men: Kieran Richardson, Zoltan Gera, Geoff Horsfield.\n\nThe ultimate nail-biter. This is the only Premier League campaign where all three relegation places were decided on the final day.\n\nAnd never mind being bottom at Christmas, West Brom had slipped back there before the last game - and remained bottom for most of the final day. The Baggies had to beat Portsmouth and hope their three relegation rivals all failed to win.\n\nNorwich were thumped by Fulham and although Southampton took the lead against Manchester United, the Red Devils fought back. So, heading into the closing stages, it was between West Brom and Crystal Palace.\n\nThe Baggies won 2-0, although celebrations for the second goal were muted as Palace had just come from behind to lead at Charlton.\n\nWith eight minutes left, Charlton levelled it up again. Then with their game over, West Brom players and staff waited on the touchline for Palace's final score: 2-2 - cue pandemonium at The Hawthorns.\n\nPortsmouth 2005-06\n\nPortsmouth picked up more points in their final 10 league games (20) than during their first 28 (18).\n\nTop league scorer: Lomana LuaLua (7).\n\nOther key men: Pedro Mendes, Gary O'Neill, Svetoslav Todorov.\n\nSometimes it just takes one goal to turn things around. With 10 games left, Pompey were eight points from safety when they hosted Manchester City.\n\nThey were set to go nine games without a win when City cleared a corner towards Pedro Mendes, who slammed a stoppage-time winner into the top corner.\n\nPortsmouth were a side transformed. Having scored four goals in their previous 10 games, they scored seven in their next two, winning at West Ham and Fulham.\n\nFurther victories over Middlesbrough, Sunderland and Wigan saw them secure safety with a game to spare, having claimed 20 points from a possible 27.\n\nFulham 2007-08\n\nFulham won eight league games - four of their first 33, then four of their last five.\n\nTop league scorer: Clint Dempsey (6).\n\nOther key men: Brian McBride, Diomansy Kamara, Danny Murphy.\n\nThe Cottagers twice came back from the brink in 2008. Derby went down with what remains the Premier League's lowest points total (11) and with 20 minutes left at Manchester City, Fulham were about to join them.\n\nRoy Hodgson's men were 2-0 down and set to go six points adrift with two games left. Surely it was over?\n\nDiomansy Kamara had other ideas. Out of nothing, the Senegalese striker pulled one back. Then Danny Murphy equalised before Kamara lashed in a stoppage-time winner.\n\nVictory over Birmingham put Fulham's fate in their own hands but with the Blues and Reading both winning on the final day, it was a tense afternoon at Portsmouth.\n\nFourteen minutes from time, Murphy headed home from a free-kick to keep Fulham up on goal difference.\n\nWigan 2011-12\n\nWigan picked up more points in their last nine games (21) than any other side - even champions Manchester City (20).\n\nTop league scorer: Franco Di Santo (7).\n\nOther key men: Gary Caldwell, Victor Moses, Shaun Maloney.\n\nWith nine games left, Wigan were only three points from safety. But this survival act was about the volume of points and the quality of the opposition.\n\nAfter one win in 14, check out Wigan's next three away games - Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal. They also had to face leaders Manchester United.\n\nIt was all hands up to the pump - and Roberto Martinez's side had eight different scorers in their last nine games.\n\nThe Latics gave themselves hope with a first-ever win at Anfield before Shaun Maloney's goal gave them a first-ever win over United. They followed that up with a first-ever win at Arsenal.\n\nAnd despite losing at Fulham, Wigan sealed the deal in style, winning their last three games to finish 15th.\n\nSunderland 2013-14\n\nBetween April and May 2014, Sunderland won four straight Premier League games – for the first time since December 2000.\n\nTop league scorer: Adam Johnson (8).\n\nOther key men: Seb Larsson, Fabio Borini, Connor Wickham.\n\nBoss Gus Poyet said Sunderland needed \"a miracle\" - and it took an unlikely hero to spark this rescue mission.\n\nOne point from 24 left the Black Cats seven points adrift with six games left and they still had to visit Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United.\n\nEnter Connor Wickham, who had just returned after spending most of the season on loan in the Championship.\n\nThe striker scored five in three as Sunderland drew 2-2 at City before beating Chelsea and Cardiff.\n\nSeb Larsson's acrobatic volley secured victory at Old Trafford and a 2-0 win over West Brom saw Sunderland stay up with a game to spare.\n\nLeicester 2014-15\n\nLeicester became just the third Premier League side to be bottom at Christmas and avoid relegation - after West Brom (2004-05) and Sunderland (2013-14).\n\nTop league scorer: Leonardo Ulloa (13).\n\nOther key men: Esteban Cambiasso, Andy King, Jamie Vardy.\n\nLeicester's extraordinary title win is even more remarkable when you consider that 29 games into the previous season, they were seven points from safety at the bottom. And that season was also bonkers.\n\nWith Nigel Pearson battling to avoid an immediate return to the Championship, the pressure seemed to show in February as he was involved in a bizarre touchline clash with Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur.\n\nThe club denied rumours that Pearson was sacked and swiftly reinstated, yet the Foxes were still bottom in April.\n\nBut a 2-1 home win over West Ham sparked a run of 22 points from 27, which saw Leicester clinch survival with a game to go and ultimately finish 14th.\n\nThe only blip during the run-in was a defeat at champions Chelsea, when Pearson walked out of the post-match news conference after asking a reporter if he was an ostrich."}

OK. Thank you very much,\" he said at the March 2 roundtable, which was captured on C-SPAN\n\nNext was Lenny Schleifer, the founder and CEO of Regeneron -- which aims to conduct clinical trials this summer -- who talked of pumping 200,000 doses per month of its therapeutic vaccine from his factory, starting in August, \"if all goes well.\"\n\nThis got Trump's attention. He leaned over the table and interrupted Schleifer mid-pitch.\n\n\"So that process would be faster than John's?\" he said, pointing at Shiver.\n\n\"It would be,\" Schleifer said, adding that the process could take \"weeks to months.\"\n\nThe only way to top that was to start talking about days, and it's exactly what the next CEO did.\n\nPresident Donald Trump leads a meeting with the White House Coronavirus Task Force and pharmaceutical executives in the Cabinet Room of the White House on March 2.\n\nStéphane Bancel of Moderna Inc. glanced across the table at the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and said he is \"very proud to be working with the US government and to have already sent, in only 42 days from the sequence of the virus, our vaccine to Dr. Fauci's team at the NIH.\"\n\nThe French-born Bancel went on to say that he needed just \"a few months\" to start phase two of a three-part clinical trial of the sort that typifies vaccine development. (The entire process often takes more than a decade.)\n\nTrump seemed to tune out everything but the talk of time.\n\n\"So you're talking over the next few months, you think you could have a vaccine?\" he asked.\n\n\"Correct. Correct,\" Bancel said, raising a hand to acknowledge Fauci shifting in his chair across the table. \"With phase two,\" Bancel clarified, just before Fauci interjected, for Trump's benefit: \"You won't have a vaccine. You'll have a vaccine to go into testing.\"\n\nTo some observers, it was a classic Bancel performance -- a rare public glimpse into his uncanny ability to say the right thing to the right people in the right moment.\n\nHis supporters say, however, he was doing what he's always done: letting Moderna's accomplishments speak for themselves.\n\nEither way, it turns out Moderna had an edge. Its scientists had already been collaborating with researchers from the National Institutes of Health on a vaccine for another coronavirus, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). So when Chinese researchers released the genomic sequence for the new coronavirus -- SARS-CoV-2, which causes the deadly disease known as Covid-19 -- in mid-January, they had a jump start.\n\nOn March 3 -- the day after the roundtable -- -- the day after the roundtable -- the FDA green-lit Moderna's product for trial, making it the first vaccine candidate to advance to the first phase of a clinical study , in which an as-yet unapproved vaccine is injected into the arms of a small group of 45 human volunteers.\n\nEstablished in 2010, Moderna has never brought a product to market, or gotten any of its nine or so vaccine candidates approved for use by the FDA. It has also never brought a product to the third and final phase of a clinical trial.\n\nAnd yet at the moment, it represents one of the country's -- and possibly world's -- best hopes for a return to the normalcy that slipped away when the microscopic enemy brought civilization to a standstill.\n\nThe federally funded trial for Moderna's vaccine candidate began in Washington state on March 16 -- two weeks after the roundtable. With a hope-starved world cheering it on, Moderna officially burst out of the gate, marking the beginning of the race for a vaccine for the new coronavirus.\n\nMajor funding injected into vaccine race\n\nThe effort received another boost on April 16, when the federal Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) awarded Moderna up to $483 million to accelerate the development and manufacturing of the vaccine. That amounts to about half of what the federal agency has doled out, with Janssen Research & Development -- part of Johnson & Johnson -- receiving $456 million, and a third company, Sanofi, receiving up to $30 million.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is a household name with a long list of approved medicines ; Sanofi has been making vaccines for more than 100 years . But much of Moderna's appeal is not what it has done, but what it says is possible: to develop a vaccine -- which normally takes years -- in record speed.\n\nAs it happens, although Moderna is not a household name, it's a company with a storied history.\n\nCNN Investigates interviewed more than 20 experts and former employees for this story and found that while some of the scientists expressed optimism that Moderna can pull it off, others voiced criticism about the hype the company has generated over the years, as well as what has been described as a caustic work culture.\n\nOthers raised concerns about the science, or challenged the wisdom of the federal government-sanctioned shortcuts in the ongoing clinical trial, in particular the FDA's approval to gloss over the animal trials that normally precede injecting an untested vaccine into healthy humans.\n\nDr. Joseph Bolen, who served as Moderna's chief scientific officer and president of research and development from 2013 to 2015, believes it was reasonable to give Moderna a shot, but was puzzled by BARDA's massive allocation -- up to $483 million -- calling it a \"big bet.\"\n\n\"I don't know what their thinking was,\" he said. \"Why so much? ... I just don't know. When I read that, I was pretty amazed.\"\n\nDr. Tal Zaks, Moderna's chief medical officer, acknowledged that the company doesn't have a product on the market, but said the government's decision was wise.\n\n\"We're a young company with an emerging technology and for that reason we have not yet brought anything to full licensure,\" he told CNN. \"But if you look at the building blocks of what we have been able to demonstrate over time -- from preclinical through our early clinical data -- this is a very promising technology.\"\n\nModerna is ahead of the pack\n\nModerna, Inc. -- originally called Moderna Therapeutics -- was founded on a big idea that would disrupt the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nIts vision is to harness a new technology that synthesizes messenger RNA, or mRNA -- essentially an instruction manual in every living cell for creating protein -- to prompt the human body to make its own medicine. The hope has been to find \"transformative\" treatments for heart disease, metabolic and genetic diseases, kidney failure, even cancer.\n\nBARDA said it plans to fund a variety of approaches.\n\n\"More than one vaccine is likely to be the solution,\" a BARDA spokesperson said in an email. \"Of note, Moderna was the first into the clinic with a vaccine.\"\n\nMeantime, Moderna is indeed moving at a fast clip: On Monday, it submitted a proposal to the FDA to enter Phase 2, subject to final safety findings from Phase 1.\n\n(The second phase of a typical clinical study ramps up the number of people -- often into the hundreds, including more members of at-risk groups. In Phase 3, the vaccine is given to thousands of people and tested for efficacy and safety, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOver the years, Moderna has sold investors on the revolutionary potential of its medicine. Bancel has been the chief narrator of the company's intoxicating story.\n\n\"We feel this is most probably the only time in our lives that we will have a chance to really change the world,\" he said in a 2013 TED Talk about how mRNA could be used as a way to regrow heart tissue in people who have suffered heart attacks.\n\nAmbition, secrecy and money has earned Moderna critics\n\nTwo of its four founders -- Derrick Rossi and Robert Langer -- are especially heavy hitters in the science community. Rossi, once an associate professor at Harvard, was hailed by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of 2011 for a novel stem-cell treatment; Langer of MIT is ranked by Google as the eighth most-cited researcher in the world, just a few notches below Sigmund Freud.\n\nModerna's unproven but potentially paradigm-shattering technology has garnered enthusiastic press: Moderna was ranked No. 1 on the CNBC Disrupter 50 list in 2015 for its goal to help \"the human body make the medicine it needs to cure a disease,\" putting it in company with eventually the likes of Airbnb, Lyft and WeWork . More recently, it was praised in an op-ed by Bill Gates -- whose namesake foundation has given millions to Moderna -- though his piece didn't mention the company by name.\n\nJUST WATCHED Bill Gates on a possible Covid-19 vaccine timeline Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bill Gates on a possible Covid-19 vaccine timeline 10:17\n\nBut Moderna's unbridled ambition, reputation for secrecy and preoccupation with venture capital have earned it detractors.\n\nIn 2016, an op-ed published in the science journal Nature scolded Moderna for not having published a single peer-reviewed paper outlining the science of its dazzling product, even as it participated in a \"schmoozefest\" at a JP Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco that announced $350 million in investments.\n\nThe piece noted that Moderna's then lack of scientific publishing was similar to that of Theranos , now disgraced for raising some $700 million in venture capital for a blood-testing technology that turned out to be a sham, turning the now-dissolved company and its embattled CEO into a symbol of tech hubris run amok.\n\nJUST WATCHED Hear what it's like to be part of a vaccine trial Replay More Videos ...

We had fantastic data back then.\"\n\nCritics call for more skepticism\n\nIn any case, the company has published dozens of papers in recent years, and several experts and former Moderna employees contacted by CNN for this story rejected any comparison to Theranos, saying the science is sound.\n\nOne former employee, who worked at the company for three years ending in 2019 -- most recently as a director -- called the comparison \"absurd.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Director of key vaccine agency says his dismissal was retaliation Replay More Videos ...

They have a strong vision, they work really hard.\"\n\nBut a former company executive had a more mixed take on the question. On the one hand, he said, the science is on a \"good foundation.\"\n\n\"They really are pushing forward the boundaries of understanding RNA,\" said the former executive, who requested anonymity because he still works in the field.\n\nIn his view, though, Moderna is a company that \"believes their own story, spins their own story and has managed to convince a lot of investors -- in-biotech investors and other non-biotech investors -- that it's true,\" he said. \"I think (people) should approach it with a little more skepticism.\"\n\nModerna's turbulent start\n\nIn the early years, Moderna was a chaotic place. Over the span of a decade, the size of its workforce has expanded from four employees to more than 700.\n\nThe culture of the company seems to have stabilized: In the past five years, it has ranked as a top biopharmaceutical employer in Science magazin e's Top Employers Survey.\n\nBut there were growing pains, some of which centered on Bancel, the only CEO the company has ever had.\n\nStéphane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, at the company's office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2017.\n\nAfeyan, a venture capitalist with a PhD in biochemical engineering from MIT, had tried to recruit Bancel to lead other projects, but Bancel -- formerly the CEO of a French diagnostics company -- had turned him down.\n\n\"I told him I was willing to take a career risk by working on something that might not work,\" Bancel told Boston magazine in 2013 . \"But it would have to be something that, if it worked, would change the world.\"\n\nWhen Afeyan asked him to join Moderna, the idea was too big for Bancel to resist. The holder of a Master of Science in chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota and an MBA from Harvard Business School joined in 2011.\n\nBancel's leadership style has come under fire from employees who have described a pressure-cooker atmosphere in which around-the-clock hours were the norm and failed experiments -- a fact of life in the world of science -- could be met with reprimand or even dismissal, according to a 2016 investigation by Stat , a health publication.\n\nJUST WATCHED Pandemic expert: 'A vaccine is the holy grail' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pandemic expert: 'A vaccine is the holy grail' 19:51\n\nThe former executive, who left in 2016, recalled that Bancel seemed to have two versions of himself: the calm public persona who makes speeches and appears on TED Talks, and the private version in corporate meetings.\n\n\"What you hear in corporate meetings is stuff like this, 'What the f**k are you taking about? It's complete bullsh*t. ... You just said six-to-nine months; I need it done in five.'\"\n\nDr. Suhaib Siddiqi, a chemist who served for a short time as Moderna's former director of chemistry in 2011, said Bancel was \"unfriendly\" and \"arrogant,\" and punished technicians for failed experiments.\n\n\"Ninety percent of the things in science fail -- that's the way the inventions are made,\" Siddiqi said. \"When it failed (at Moderna), he just shifted the blame to the technicians and fired them.\"\n\nBancel disputes the characterization.\n\n\"Science is complicated and many things fail,\" Bancel, who declined CNN an interview, responded in a written statement. \"I don't recall one employee being fired since we started the company, because of science failing. If that had been the case, most scientists would have left the company and the company could not have gotten to the point it is.\"\n\nHe added: \"We are creating a new class of transformative mRNA medicines to improve the lives of patients. When there is an opportunity to help patients, every day matters. So, there is an urgency to what we are doing because patients are waiting. We are privileged to be a part of a broad ecosystem of researchers from academia and industry who are expanding the understanding of mRNA.\"\n\nSome former employees spoke in defense of Bancel.\n\n\"As a person I like him,\" said Matthias John, the molecular biologist that left in 2016. \"He's a little bit of a fanatic. But he's not in my opinion a cheater or pretender. It is his personality -- that he's pushing hard and he expected everybody's pushing the same way.\"\n\nThe former director who left in 2019 said Bancel has brought in a leadership team with experience in biopharmaceutical development that has \"tempered the intensity.\"\n\nBut in 2014, the work environment became too much even for Rossi, a co-founder of Moderna, who says his team developed the company's core technology at Harvard Medical School.\n\nRossi said he butted heads with Bancel, and that the company and its investors had a way of taking credit for the ideas of its scientists, including his own -- an allegation that Moderna's leadership denies.\n\nBut Rossi, who later went on to become an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and is now the CEO of another biotech company called Convelo Therapeutics, said he believes in the technology. He continues to have a financial stake in the company.\n\n\"I'm very optimistic,\" he said. \"It's still going on the exact concept that it was founded on.\"\n\nRossi, who said that he's heard that the culture at Moderna has mellowed, added that on some level, the cutthroat nature of the place made sense.\n\n\"I founded the company because I wanted to make an impact on human health,\" he said. \"The CEO's job is to make money for investors.\"\n\nAfeyan, the Moderna board chairman, fiercely defends Bancel. He told CNN the characterizations of Bancel as a gifted fundraiser are misplaced and even \"derogatory,\" saying it's a way for detractors to smear him with faint praise.\n\n\"He's a skilled team builder, he's a skilled product developer, he's a skilled strategist, he's a skilled partnership forger ... he's all of those things,\" Afeyan said. \"In order to fuel all that, he needs to have come up with money and we did, in a way that's unprecedented in the biotech industry. Also by tenfold. That's why he has detractors.\"\n\nThe big deals that shaped Moderna\n\nIn 2013, Moderna received $240 million from UK pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca for a license to develop RNA-based drugs to combat a range of ailments, from cardiovascular disease to kidney failure to cancer. It was one of the largest Big Pharma licensing deals ever conducted for a drug not yet in trials. The next year, Moderna and Alexion Pharmaceuticals inked a $100 million deal to develop drugs to treat rare diseases, including a rare hereditary disease called Crigler-Najjar syndrome, which can cause brain damage in infants.\n\nOther gargantuan deals include a $325 million multi-part pact with Merck for a cancer vaccine and a $315 million agreement with Vertex for a treatment for cystic fibrosis.\n\nThe clinical trials associated with most of those companies have advanced , but the Alexion agreement cratered. Alexion executives said the company decided to move in a new direction . But safety issues had surfaced in studies, with animals exhibiting liver problems, meaning it wasn't safe enough to test in humans, according to a 2017 Stat investigation\n\nA scientist in the lab at Moderna in Cambridge, Massachusetts on February 28.\n\nAfeyan said it is true that Alexion's experiments showed animal toxicity, but added that Moderna has since changed its formulations and, in human trials, \"we haven't seen any of that.\"\n\nModerna gradually began to shift more focus on vaccines. Experts and former employees say that progress with therapeutics was much slower and more difficult to get to point where it could be used as promised in humans. Messenger RNA activates the body's instinct to get rid of the foreign invader, which works better for single dose vaccines but creates safety issues for longer-term use in chronic diseases.\n\nJeff Ellsworth, who served as Moderna's former senior director of preclinical pharmacology and the head of rare genetic diseases until he left in 2013, remembers standing around a white board in his office with two company executives, discussing the data used in animal studies for drugs meant to treat rare genetic diseases.\n\n\"We all kind of looked at each other and said, 'Oh. We should probably be a vaccine company,' because these things stimulate antibody responses,\" he said.\n\nSaid Rossi: \"It's the perfect technology for the threat we face.\"\n\nThe problem is, in part because the field is crowded, the vaccine arena was perceived as less ambitious than therapeutics among investors, who saw it as a \"loss leader\" financially -- that is, a money loser, or perhaps a modest moneymaker. Many considered it a low-margin commodity\n\n\"Most of the biotech community did not value vaccines,\" Ellsworth said. \"It was very hard to move that stuff forward. Because people said, 'Oh, vaccines, nobody's going to pay for that -- it's no big deal.'\"\n\nBut Bancel -- who pulled in a salary of more than $920,000 , plus a bonus of $1 million in 2019 -- has ably applied his persuasive powers to vaccines.\n\nIn a \"Mad Money\" interview on CNBC in January, Bancel wowed host Jim Cramer with his description of a potential therapeutic \"personalized cancer vaccine\" by Moderna using mRNA technology.\n\n\"In our lifetime?\" Cramer asked.\n\n\"It's happening actually right now,\" Bancel answered. \"We compare every letter of DNA ... of a cancer cell and a healthy cell, and from that we deduce what do we need to do in our product, just for your cancer.\"\n\n\"It's almost science fiction, what you're up to,\" Cramer replied. \"I think it's incredible.\"\n\nIn 2018, the company changed its name from Moderna Therapeutics to Moderna, Inc. and beefed up its vaccine portfolio: flu, Zika and CMV, a common virus that can cause developmental delay in infants. The list would grow , although none yet has been approved.\n\nFor a time, despite its deepening involvement in a supposed money loser, Moderna's bubble only seemed to inflate. In late 2018, it went public. Raising some $600 million, its initial public offering was the largest in the history of biotech -- despite the fact that its technology remained unproven.\n\nModerna's valuation ballooned to $7.5 billion -- up from an already impressive $5 billion from a year and a half prior.\n\nStill, there were signs of an impending nosedive: Moderna -- which currently generates revenue primarily through investments by collaboration partners -- ended 2019 with a $514 million net loss. True to swashbuckling startup form, the nation's wealthiest biotech firm has incurred significant losses since its 2010 inception; at the close of 2019, its accumulated deficit was $1.5 billion, according to a year-end filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThen came the new coronavirus and Covid-19, which has killed nearly 63,000 Americans since February and 233,000 people worldwide.\n\nFor the world, it was a disaster. For Moderna, it arrived just in time.\n\nAs the economy tanked, shares in Moderna surged in February when the news of its vaccine emerged. They shot up again -- by more than 24 percent, to $26.49 -- on March 16, the day the clinical trial of its vaccine made headlines. The stock price kept rising and rocketed again on April 17 -- with news of the federal government's nearly half-a-billion-dollar investment -- to beyond $45. Its valuation climbed to $10 billion.\n\nThe new coronavirus, according to Forbes, turned the 47-year-old Bancel into a billionaire\n\nVaccine pipeline is a funnel: 'very few things survive'\n\nTo try to bring a vaccine to market is to try to beat the odds.\n\nDr. Myron Levine, a professor and infectious disease expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, cautioned that most vaccines fail.\n\n\"I've been in this business a very long time -- a half a century,\" he said. \"A vaccine pipeline is the shape of a funnel. A lot of things go in one end; very few things survive.\"\n\nStill, Levine thinks Moderna could make a breakthrough.\n\n\"There's a real good chance this will be the moment for the RNA vaccine -- they've been improved and tweaked,\" he said. \"I hope and pray that they will work.\"\n\nModerna didn't invent the mRNA approach, but is the company that has \"cornered the market\" on the idea, said the former executive who left in 2016.\n\n\"Henry Ford wasn't the first carmaker, but he managed to scale in a more effective way,\" he said.\n\nThe science of messenger RNA is complex, but the oft-touted bottom-line potential benefits are easy to understand: safety and speed.\n\nConventional vaccines involve injecting a tiny piece of a weakened or dead virus into the body to stimulate an immune response in the cells.\n\nIn theory, an mRNA vaccine enables scientists to plug a small piece of the coronavirus's genetic code into a human cell to create a synthetic copy of the virus's spike protein. That's the part of SARS-CoV-2 that resembles a plastic bristle on a hairbrush, and which attaches to human cells. Because it is just a small portion of the virus, the synthetically created spike protein can't infect a person . And partly because there is no need to manipulate a virus in the lab, the process is faster.\n\nA biotech company in Germany has begun its first human trials of a potential Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nThe coronavirus spike-protein lookalike would then be produced by the body's own cells. If all goes well, the body then counterattacks the \"invader\" -- the synthetic antigen created by a person's own cell -- with antibodies.\n\nThe technology \"teaches the human body to recognize the virus by teaching the body to make snippets of the virus on its own,\" said Zaks, Moderna's chief medical officer.\n\nOn January 11, Chinese researchers released the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, a 30,000-character string of the letters a, u, g and c.\n\nLargely because of the ongoing cooperation between Moderna and NIH, the process of designing the mRNA for delivery was lightning fast. Indeed, it took just 42 days, as Bancel told Trump.\n\nOfficials with the National Institutes of Health are bullish.\n\nJUST WATCHED Lead scientist says coronavirus vaccine could be ready soon Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lead scientist says coronavirus vaccine could be ready soon 01:35\n\n\"A lot of our work that we've done previously has essentially driven us into what we call a rapid response,\" said Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett, the lead scientist for coronavirus research at the National Institutes of Health, in a recent interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta. \"The really interesting part about this is that we have a collaboration with Moderna,\" she added.\n\nThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases -- a branch of the NIH -- said Moderna's vaccine platform is well-suited for responding to emerging outbreaks such as novel coronaviruses.\n\nIt \"can be produced more quickly than with many other vaccine platforms,\" the NIAID said in an emailed statement. \"Once the genetic information of a given emerging virus becomes available, scientists can quickly select a sequence to express an immunogen in the existing mRNA platform.\"\n\nThe science has its skeptics\n\nBut some experts are skeptical of the science.\n\nFor starters, in the rush to get started, the FDA allowed Moderna's RNA vaccine -- called mRNA-1273 -- to essentially gloss over the animal-testing that typically precede clinical trials in humans. Given the nature of this emergency, they are happening in parallel.\n\nSiddiqi said this is cause for alarm.\n\n\"I would not let that [vaccine] to be injected in my body,\" he said. \"I would demand: Where is the toxicity data from the lab?\"\n\nProfessor Nikolai Petrovsky at Flinders University in Australia, who is collaborating with Oracle to use computer models and AI technology to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, has concerns about the mRNA trials, insisting the US government has taken an unproven vaccine and \"put (it) straight into humans.\"\n\n\"It's a double game,\" he said. \"An unproven platform for a new disease with no animal testing.\"\n\nBut while these experts felt dosing humans before animal trials could happen was questionable in practice, Zaks of Moderna said it would be \"unethical to wait,\" given the urgency of the pandemic.\n\nThe FDA, in a statement to CNN, said it was \"unable to comment on specific unapproved products.\" However, it said that when the agency evaluates the need for a vaccine study, it considers the relevant data. \"If the FDA's evaluation of these data support initiating human studies of a candidate coronavirus vaccine without first completing additional toxicology studies, then the FDA would consider allowing such human studies to proceed.\"\n\nPetrovsky also noted that while NIH and Moderna worked on a MERS vaccine, they hadn't collaborated on a SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) vaccine. MERS is \"quite a different virus than SARS and Covid-19,\" he said. \"MERS binds are different receptors, different pattern of disease. ... I would be much more comfortable with SARS data.\"\n\nPetrovsky said that while RNA vaccines are very fast to make, evidence that they are going to work is scant.\n\n\"In the past, we've seen they have poor immunogenicity, which means they don't stimulate the immune system very well,\" he said.\n\nSaid Zaks: \"We've demonstrated the utility to generate the right kind of immune response time and again in multiple phase one trials.\"\n\nThe challenge of a dangerous phenomenon\n\nOne frequent hurdle for vaccine developers is a phenomenon known as disease enhancement, in which the vaccine actually promotes the infection and makes the disease worse.\n\n\"The worst possible thing you do is vaccinate somebody to prevent infection and actually make them worse,\" Fauci said at a White House briefing last month.\n\nThis phenomenon underscores the importance of animal trials, experts say.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, worked on development of a vaccine for SARS. Some of the animals he vaccinated wound up sicker than the ones he didn't vaccinate, once they were exposed to the virus.\n\nHe told Reuters that he believes the Moderna trial should conduct animal studies prior to injecting the vaccine in humans.\n\n\"If there is immune enhancement in laboratory animals vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine, that's a showstopper,\" he told the news organization.\n\nA Moderna spokesperson said the company has not seen signs of enhanced disease in animal trials with the MERS vaccine that it was developing with NIH.\n\nSean Doyle has his blood drawn as part of a vaccine trial for coronavirus at Emory University.\n\n\"Enhanced disease is a clinical finding that is very rarely seen,\" she said in an email.\n\nPotential setbacks fall into two broad categories: the vaccine isn't strong enough to produce an immune response or the vaccine causes safety issues.\n\n\"It's possible there's no actual production of antibodies, in which because either the mRNA didn't get into the cells, the cells didn't make the proteins from the mRNA or the immune system didn't recognize those proteins ... or the dose was too low,\" Dr. Evan Anderson, the lead investigator of the Moderna vaccine study at Emory University where part of the human trial is taking place, told CNN's Gupta in a recent interview\n\nAnderson added that there is a \"theoretical possibility\" that the vaccine could trigger an \"enhanced immune response\" that actually worsens the illness.\n\nJason Schrum, a founding scientist at Moderna, also pointed out that the vaccine formulation listed on Moderna's clinical trial page for Covid-19 doesn't seem to include a key element to conjure a strong efficacy in any vaccine: the adjuvants.\n\nAdjuvants stimulate the body's immune system to react to the vaccine antigen -- the molecules that trigger an immune response in the body. In other words, they boost the body's immune response.\n\n\"Typically, what you see in any vaccine if they use adjuvants, they clearly identify that and say this is the purpose of using in the vaccine formulation as an adjuvant,\" said Schrum, who is no longer with the company. \"In that one [Moderna], I just don't see that.\"\n\nModerna confirmed that it is not using an adjuvant.\n\n\"We have not used adjuvants in our vaccine clinical trials,\" the spokesperson wrote in an email, adding that the trials have shown that Moderna's vaccines induce an immune response similar to that seen with natural infection.\n\nThe former BARDA official told CNN that Moderna generates a lot of \"hype\" for an organization that has never entered the third and final phase of a clinical trial for a drug or vaccine.\n\n\"I don't think it's misplaced to -- I want to say question -- but have some healthy skepticism about the current efficacy of their technology,\" the expert said.\n\nIan Haydon of Seattle is one of the trial participants who volunteered to take a shot in the arm in April. He said that so far -- after a couple of weeks -- aside from a sore arm for a day or two after the injection, he has experienced no symptoms.\n\n\"I'm eating normally, I'm sleeping normally, I feel fine,\" said Haydon, a 29-year-old science writer and a biotech consultant.\n\nFar from assuming he's immune, Haydon said he's being more careful than ever.\n\n\"Now that I am a subject of study, now would kind of be the worst time for me to get sick with the coronavirus,\" he said. \"I'm keeping locked up at my house, only going out to get groceries, hand-washing, wearing a mask, just like everybody should be.\"\n\nPetrovsky said the United States is unique in how it has poured so much money into \"one experimental technology.\"\n\n\"The danger here is ... if the US just backs one or two horses and they fall to the back of the pack, we're not going to have an effective vaccine in the US anytime soon.\"\n\nBut Zaks says Moderna has delivered on its promises to US officials about its coronavirus vaccine, saying, \"When our CEO said that we would get this fast into the clinic, we did.\"\n\nThat, he said, combined with the company's potential, is why \"the US government stepped in and picked our platform as one of the major investments that Tony Fauci and the team are making in. And I think if you stay in tuned, you should expect to see us be able to deliver on that.\""}

Even in a best-case scenario, people will continue to die from the virus, they predicted.\n\n\"This thing's not going to stop until it infects 60 to 70 percent of people,\" Mike Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota, told CNN.\n\n\"The idea that this is going to be done soon defies microbiology.\"\n\nOsterholm has been writing about the risk of pandemics for 20 years and has advised several presidents. He wrote the report along with Harvard School of Public Health epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch, who is also a top expert on pandemics; Dr. Kristine Moore, a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologist who is now medical director for CIDRAP; and historian John Barry, who wrote the 2004 book \"The Great Influenza\" about the 1918 flu pandemic.\n\nWaiting for herd immunity\n\nBecause Covid-19 is new, no one has any immunity, they said. \"The length of the pandemic will likely be 18 to 24 months, as herd immunity gradually develops in the human population,\" they wrote.\n\nTheir predictions are different from models presented by groups such as the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington or the models produced by Imperial College London, whose report predicting millions of deaths in the US and UK helped galvanize responses by both governments.\n\nThe CIDRAP-led team used those reports, historical data on past pandemics, and published reports about the medical details of Covid-19 to put together their forecast.\n\n\"I have said for a long time that when you are trying to understand how infectious disease is going to unfold, you should rely on history as well as models,\" Lipsitch told CNN. For instance, pandemic infections don't tend to die down in the summer, like seasonal flu does., he said.\n\nCovid-19 is most comparable to a pandemic strain of influenza, they said.\n\n\"Because of a longer incubation period, more asymptomatic spread, and a higher R0, COVID-19 appears to spread more easily than flu,\" they wrote in the report. R0 is the average number of other people infected by each patient.\n\n\"A higher R0 means more people will need to get infected and become immune before the pandemic can end,\" they add. \"Based on the most recent flu pandemics, this outbreak will likely last 18 to 24 months.\"\n\nPreparing for the worst\n\nThey said government officials should stop telling people the pandemic could be ending and instead prepare citizens for a long haul.\n\nThree scenarios are possible, they said:\n\nScenario 1: The first wave of Covid-19 in spring 2020 is followed by a series of repetitive smaller waves that occur through the summer and then consistently over a one- to two-year period, gradually diminishing sometime in 2021\n\nScenario 2: The first wave of Covid-19 is followed by a larger wave in the fall or winter and one or more smaller waves in 2021. \"This pattern will require the reinstitution of mitigation measures in the fall in an attempt to drive down spread of infection and prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed,\" they wrote. \"This pattern is similar to what was seen with the 1918-19 pandemic.\"\n\nScenario 3: A \"slow burn\" of ongoing transmission. \"This third scenario likely would not require the reinstitution of mitigation measures, although cases and deaths will continue to occur.\"\n\nStates and territories should plan for scenario 2, the worst-case scenario, they recommended.\n\n\"Government officials should develop concrete plans, including triggers for reinstituting mitigation measures, for dealing with disease peaks when they occur,\" they advised.\n\nLipsitch and Osterholm both said they are surprised by the decisions many states are making to lift restrictions aimed at controlling the spread of the virus.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"I think it's an experiment.

One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny,\" the former vice president and presumptive Democratic 2020 nominee said in the statement.\n\nHe continued, \"Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways.\"\n\n\"But this much bears emphasizing,\" he said. \"She has said she raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers from my office at the time. They -- both men and a woman -- have said, unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues. News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one -- not one -- who corroborated her allegations in any way. Indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way -- as indeed I would not have.\"\n\nIn the MSNBC interview, Biden said he is \"saying unequivocally, it never, never happened. It didn't. It never happened.\"\n\nHe said he has not reached out to Reade, and does not remember her making any complaint.\n\n\"This never happened, and when she first made the claim, we made it clear that it never happened, and it's as simple as that,\" he said.\n\nAllegation presents challenging balancing act\n\nBiden's only response for weeks has been a statement from deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield highlighting the former vice president's role in crafting the Violence Against Women Act and saying what Reade had claimed \"absolutely did not happen.\" Former Biden staffers also said Reade had not complained about Biden at the time.\n\nThe allegation comes as Biden is preparing to take on President Donald Trump in the general election . More than a dozen women have leveled allegations against Trump, ranging from unwelcome advances to sexual harassment and assault. Trump has denied those allegations.\n\nFor some of Biden's supporters and surrogates, questions related to Reade's allegation have presented a challenging balancing act -- of expressing support for Biden's candidacy and character while not dismissing a sexual assault allegation. Democrats in particular have vocally championed the #MeToo movement in recent years, advocating that all accusers to be fully heard and recognized. And gender dynamics are expected to remain at the forefront of the 2020 race, as Biden begins his search for a female running mate.\n\nSome of the women widely expected to be on Biden's shortlist of vice presidential nominees, including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, have recently been asked about the allegation; Biden's allies have pointed to his decades-long advocacy for women and victims of abuse, including his work on the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nBiden said in the MSNBC interview he did not know why Reade was now alleging he had sexually assaulted her.\n\n\"I'm not going to question her motive,\" he said. \"I don't know why she's saying this. I don't know why after 27 years all of a sudden this gets raised. I don't understand it.\"\n\n\"She has a right to say whatever she wants to say. But I have a right to say, look at the facts,\" he said.\n\nReade's allegation\n\nReade, who worked as a junior staffer at Biden's office in 1993, had publicly accused Biden last year of touching her shoulders and neck and making her feel uncomfortable.\n\nReade first came forward with her sexual assault allegation against Biden in interviews this year with multiple media outlets, including CNN.\n\nShe told CNN that in 1993, when she was working as an aide in Biden's Senate office, she was asked to deliver a duffel bag to the then-Delaware senator. In a corridor somewhere in the Capitol Hill complex, Reade said Biden \"had me up against the wall; he used his knee to spread open my legs,\" and \"put his fingers inside me.\"\n\nA friend of Reade's, who asked to remain anonymous in order to protect her privacy, told CNN that Reade had told her in detail that she had been sexually assaulted by Biden on Capitol Hill. The friend said she believes Reade called her within days of the alleged assault.\n\nformer neighbor of Reade has come forward and told CNN that Reade told her about the alleged assault within a few years of the incident, in the mid-1990s, and a newly surfaced video from 1993 appears to feature Reade's mother calling into \"Larry King Live\" to seek advice around the time of the alleged assault about how to handle \"problems\" her daughter had while working for a prominent US senator. Reade told CNN that she is certain the voice in the video belongs to her mother, Jeanette Altimus, who died a few years ago.\n\nThe Washington Post interviewed Reade's brother, Collin Moulton, who told the paper that she had told him in 1993 that Biden had \"behaved inappropriately by touching her neck and shoulders\" but not about the alleged sexual assault. Several days after that interview with Reade's brother, the Post said, \"he said in a text message that he recalled her telling him that Biden had put his hand 'under her clothes.'\"\n\nMoulton later told CNN in a text message that Reade told him in the early 1990s that she had been asked to bring Biden his gym bag, and that in a private setting, he had cornered her against the wall and put his hands under her clothes.\n\nReade has said that she complained to multiple colleagues in the office about interactions with Biden that made her uncomfortable, but not about the alleged assault. Reade has also said that she filed a complaint with a personnel office on Capitol Hill at the time, but that she does not have a copy of it. It is unclear what kind of complaint -- and at what office -- Reade may have filed.\n\nBiden's Senate papers\n\nPressure has mounted on Biden to release his papers from his Senate days, which some say could shed light on the allegation. Those papers are at the University of Delaware and will not be made publicly available until two years after Biden leaves public life.\n\nThe university said this week it is still curating the collection of documents, a process expected to last into the spring of 2021. Therefore, a university spokesperson said Thursday, it cannot identify what documents and files can be found in the collection.\n\nBiden says his papers at the university do not contain personnel files. But, he said, personnel files from the Senate during those days would be kept at the National Archives.\n\n\"I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden also said on MSNBC that the his papers at the University of Delaware will remain sealed because they could become political \"fodder\" during his presidential campaign.\n\n\"The idea that they would all be made public while I was running for office can be taken out of context,\" Biden said. He added that the documents would cover topics like meetings with foreign heads of state.\n\nAsked whether he would release all complaints against him, Biden said, \"I'm prepared to do that,\" and that to the best of his knowledge there are no claims of sexual misconduct on his part.\n\nCNN has interviewed half a dozen former Biden aides who worked in his Senate office in the early 1990s. All of them said they were not aware of any sexual harassment or assault allegations.\n\nMarianne Baker, who was Biden's executive assistant in the 1980s and 1990s when Biden was a senator, also previously said in a statement provided through the Biden campaign that she was never aware of any reports of inappropriate conduct, including from Reade.\n\n\"In all my years working for Senator Biden, I never once witnessed, or heard of, or received, any reports of inappropriate conduct, period -- not from Ms. Reade, not from anyone. I have absolutely no knowledge or memory of Ms. Reade's accounting of events, which would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional, and as a manager,\" Baker said. \"These clearly false allegations are in complete contradiction to both the inner workings of our Senate office and to the man I know and worked so closely with for almost two decades.\"\n\nDennis Toner, who was Biden's deputy chief of staff at the time and one of the people Reade said she had discussed her complaints with, told CNN in an interview on Thursday that he had no recollection of Reade or any conversation related to sexual harassment allegations.\n\n\"I clearly would remember if we -- that is, if Tara and myself -- had any kind of conversation regarding sexual harassment allegations, let alone something involving Sen. Biden. It would stick in my mind. It would be burned in my mind,\" Toner said. \"I don't understand it.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional comments from Biden's statement and from his interview on MSNBC."}

That’s all I want. All of these people, in the same place, at the same time.”\n\nSo spoke Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) to husband Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) in “One Last Ride,” Parks and Recreation’s stellar series finale, as the gang readied for new adventures that would take them in different directions. Near the end of the revered local-government comedy’s final episode, way back in 2015, Ben delivered to Leslie her dream scenario at Pawnee City Hall: “Everyone in the same room, at the same time.”\n\nFive years later, Parks and Recreation re-granted that wish — and this time, everyone was in the same Zoom, at the same time. (Technically, they were in the same Gryzzl, but we couldn’t pass up the rhyme.) Co-creator/showrunner Mike Schur reconvened the show’s writers and penned a heartening half-hour special that reunited the entire cast via video — in character! — for, well, let's call it one more ride. The cause for this new scripted adventure was more than just: “A Parks and Recreation Special” is designed to raise money for Feeding America’s COVID-19 Response Fund, which aids food banks across the nation. You can donate right here through May 21, and $500,000 in matching donations will be made by State Farm, Subaru of America, NBCUniversal, and the Parks team. (As of Friday afternoon, the special has already raised $2.8 million.)\n\nFor 30 minutes, in the middle of an unrelenting, unnerving quarantine, viewers caught up with Leslie & Co. in 2020 — a year that wasn’t explored in the finale’s flash-forwards. Department of the Interior deputy director Leslie Knope was keeping busy in her office during the park closures, running a phone tree to check in on her sheltering-at-home friends. Congressman Ben was homeschooling their triplets and formulating an idea for a Cones of Dunshire claymation movie. Longtime social distancer Ron (Nick Offerman) was holed up at his cabin, producing way too much venison jerky and fending off Tammy 2 (Megan Mullally). April (Aubrey Plaza) played a sartorial grab-bag game while husband Andy (Chris Pratt) tried to figure out how to Burt Macklin himself out of their locked shed. Ann (Rashida Jones) had been doing outpatient care as a nurse, and Chris (Rob Lowe) was doing his part by donating blood four times a week. Tom (Aziz Ansari) cycled through flawed quarantine business ideas (protective masks with other people’s teeth printed on it). The ever-charitable Donna (Retta) bought Joe (Keegan Michael-Key) a Mercedes that matched hers. And the man with whom no one wanted to connect — Pawnee Mayor Jerry/Garry (Jim O’Heir) — found new self-defeat in biffing his video-chat settings.\n\nPlenty of other Pawnee players popped up: Bobby Newport (Paul Rudd) opened the special (and hadn't heard about the pandemic); Ben and Leslie appeared on At Home with Joan with Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) and her frightening doll friends, as well as Ya Heard with Perd with Perd Hapley (Jay Jackson). And during those shows' commercial breaks, Dennis Feinstein (Jason Mantzoukas) pitched a Miracle Cure scent (“the cologne proven to kill anything it comes in contact with”), Jeremy Jamm (Jon Glaser) promoted a chilling self-dentistry service, and Porsche-damaged Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz) hawked his 930-1-Ralphio line.\n\nAfter an anti-pep talk to younger audiences by Andy’s Johnny Karate (which ended when he “pulled something in [his] butthole\"), things went full-heartfelt as Leslie received that present she always wants: complete connection. In the special's loveliest moment, the gang sang along as Andy performed the Lil’ Sebastian tribute anthem, “5,000 Candles in the Wind.” Ron then offered up sturdy advice to the indefatigable Leslie, who served as his more-than-workplace proximity acquaintance for seven seasons: “Don’t spend all your time looking after other people — look after yourself once in a while.” “That’s good advice. I’ll call you tomorrow,\" responded Leslie. \"I'm sure you will,\" returned Ron.\n\nWhile you wait for the phone to ring from the Leslie, Ron, Ben, Tom, Donna, April, Andy, Chris, Ann, Garry, or [shudders] Jamm in your life, let's Zoom in Parks overlord Mike Schur, who'll take you behind the scenes of this winning special. Spread your wings and fly into the Q&A below.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: When Parks and Rec ended in 2015, did you ever think, \"The only way we’ll ever do a reunion special is if we need to raise money for charity during a global pandemic?\"\n\nMIKE SCHUR: That was our first thought. We said, “Obviously, if there’s a global pandemic, we'll get back together. But other than that, forget it.” I really honestly didn't ever think it was going to happen. Even as the reboot craze and the reunion craze struck and those things were floating around in the ether, I still was like, “I don't think so. I don't see why.” Amy and I and the whole crew had the same feeling, which was: That show had a very specific point to make and we felt like we made the point and then we ended the show and we moved on. I always felt like if there wasn't a really compelling reason, there'd be no point in just getting back together just to get back together — as fun as it wasn't as much as we all loved each other.\n\nBut when this thing happened, it was kind of a different story. Because now you're thinking with a different calculator and you're thinking to yourself, “Well, there are a tremendous number of people who need help, and there's a tremendous amount of potential energy in the idea of this group of people getting back together. And if you could combine those two things and use the ‘one-time reunion’ as a way to be noisy and to try to get people happy for half an hour and maybe to throw 25 bucks at a website — that’s something worth doing. If we could pull it off, it would be worth it.” So the joy of making this project and this little special is that I had this whole argument of why we should do it prepared, and I never had to make the argument because the second that I suggested it to everybody, they all said yes! [Laughs] So it came together very quickly.\n\nWhen NBC approached you about organizing a script read of an episode, you suggested a scripted in-character special instead. It’s more thrilling for fans this way, of course, but did the idea of re-opening the story and trying to capture the old magic come with butterflies?\n\nOh, god, yes! I think I would have more butterflies if we were doing it for no reason. The fact that we did it as a special and we're doing it for charity takes a lot of the creative pressure off it because the point of it isn't, “Let's try to do something that's going to make people so invested in it, and it'll get such a high rating that we’ll get picked up for another season.” It's purely and simply a way to try to make a half-hour of happy entertainment that makes people feel warm and fuzzy during a time of not a lot of warm and fuzziness.\n\nThe objective of a TV show normally is one thing, and the objective of this is very different. But even given that, I really want people to enjoy it. I don't want it to simply be a novelty or anything like that. I hope we made something that does really remind people of the show and makes them happy in the way that the show used to make them happy — if in fact the show did make them happy. [Laughs] If they weren’t fans of it, they won’t suddenly start liking it now.\n\nWas it fairly easy to get back into the groove of writing these characters for this special?\n\nIt wasn't that hard, in part because one of the first things I did after the cast said that they would do it is I emailed the six writers who worked on it with me, who were six people who were very much involved with the show for a long period of time. Because I knew very clearly that this was not something I could do myself. Much like the show always was, it needed to be a giant collaborative team effort. So once Megan [Amram] and Joe [Mande] and Jen [Statsky] and Aisha [Muharrar] and Dave [King], and Matt [Murray] all signed on, I relaxed a lot because I knew that it was (a) possible and (b) would go a lot more smoothly.\n\nWe didn't have a lot of time at all to do it. We conceived of and wrote the script very quickly as a group over about three-and-a-half days. If I had been doing it alone, I would've had a panic attack. But knowing I had six excellent writers who were very familiar with the show working on it with me, that helped me relax a lot. In fact, Aisha, who was on the show almost the entire time, when I asked her to do it, she said, “Sure!” and then that night she emailed a giant chunk of dialogue. She was like, “I was just thinking about it and I wrote this.” And I was like, “Oh, this is amazing! It's already happening! People are writing things!” The difference between it happening and not happening is people like Aisha Muharrar who just cared about the show and thought it sounded fun to write to those characters again.\n\nLeslie — someone who preaches teamwork, hard work, connection, and public service — is the first person you'd want on your side during times like these. She would have 30 binders prepared just for the pandemic. This show's characters seem primed to tackle this topic. Did that feel like a value-added advantage for you, that the pulling-together ethos and heart of the show lined up with the special that you aimed to create?\n\nYeah. The No. 1 reason to write something new instead of doing a table read of an old episode was if the cast is going to get together — I felt like we owed it to them to write something new instead of just going over territory we had already gone over, which seemed like kind of a waste. But the other reason to do it is because the themes of the world right now are very much in line with the themes of the show. Leslie was a person who believed wholeheartedly in the power of interpersonal connection and in the power of structures to provide comfort and service in times of crisis. She believed in helping people and she believed in keeping her friends together, and she believed in fighting through Ron Swanson's grumpiness to try to remind him that she cares about him and that they're friends.\n\nIt was very easy to line up the kind of subject matter of the day with the characters on the show. And then there were all these weird things, like Ann was a nurse. Well, that's pretty relevant! Ron talks all the time about how much he likes to be alone, and that's kind of relevant. While we were writing it, you'd see an article, “Should the national parks reopen?” And I was like, “Well, that’s what Leslie would be fighting for, right?” There's a weird sort of kismet about the fact that it was a show about local government, and every story in every newspaper right now is about the role of local government in people's lives and the decisions they're making. So it all lined up in some weird way. If the show had been about a bunch of people who worked on an oil derrick or something, I don't know that it would have been such a no-brainer to do another episode [laughs], but their jobs and the worldview of the show and the themes of the show were obviously very relevant to what's going on.\n\nYou mentioned that while this special is canon, you didn’t reverse-engineer any Easter eggs that point toward the finale. How much time over those few days of writing did you spend charting courses for these characters that specifically lined up with the flash-forward bursts in the finale, just to make sure that the logic tracked?\n\nWe did have to do a fair amount of that, just first to remember where the hell everybody would’ve been in 2020 and what their jobs were. Then there were a couple little aspects of the timeline that we just kind of fudged a little bit. I'm not sure Tom Haverford would have exactly been about to go on this book tour at this moment or not. It’s a little hard to tell because it wasn't a 100-percent clear in the timeline of the show as it was explained to the audience exactly when he wrote that book and when his book tour would have been. But generally speaking, Ben's a Congressman and Leslie's working at national parks in the Department of Interior, and Ann and Chris are in Michigan, and April and Andy are in Washington. We were able to try to figure out where everyone would be and we didn't want to just blow everything up that we had done in the finale. We wanted this to be considered canon in the world of the show — to whatever extent that matters.\n\nIt matters! What was the biggest creative challenge in bringing this story to life? Explaining why the couples weren’t together in quarantine would seem to be one. On the other hand, real life created an advantage for you when it came to Nick and Megan.\n\nThat was the fun part. We were like, “Well, what do we have?” Remember in The Princess Bride when Westley wakes up and he says, “What are our assets and what are our liabilities?” That's basically what we did. We were like, “Well, what are our liabilities? Those are clear. None of these people can be in the same place at the same time. They have to all shoot from home. We can't be with them when they're shooting. They have to do their own hair and makeup and lighting and directing and camera-operating and everything else. Those are some pretty goddamn significant liabilities when it comes to making it an episode of television.” And then we were like, “Well, what are our assets?” And there aren’t many, but one of them was, “Well, Nick and Megan live together!” [Laughs] So we can use that.\n\nA big thing that we were trying to accomplish was to not make it just seem like a Zoom call because everything looks like a Zoom call right now; every reality show and every news show and everything is just the same exact thing. It's people in their own houses sitting at their own desks, looking directly into a computer. Obviously, a gigantic chunk of this was going to have to be the same thing, but wherever we could — I don't remember who actually pitched the fake commercials idea, but that was very much from the world of the show. And it was like, “Oh, that's perfect! Because that's how we get Jon Glaser! And that's how we get Ben Schwartz. And that's how we get Jason Mantzoukas.” That came on the heels of having the idea to have Leslie and Ben be doing a little media blitz, and that's what allowed us to get Perd Hapley and Joan Callamezzo. So we just kept thinking, \"What are our assets, if any?\" And we made use of as many of them as we could.\n\nWhat was the biggest hurdle on the production side? It must have been a difficult task to coordinate all this footage, and you must have had to send a lot of iPhones out into the world.\n\nYeah, it was intense. The majority of the credit goes to [executive producer] Morgan Sackett, who directed it and also produced it. He was on that part of it from the beginning. He was like, “There's only one way to do this. We make these little rigs. There’s a little tripod with an iPhone mounted in it, and we load in this app that allows people to shoot at the right frame rate. And there's a little lighting rig and the light is attached to it so that they don't look terrible and they're not backlit from the window.” And he just arranged to get those rigs into the hands of all of the actors after having been properly wiped down and de-virusified for safety. Morgan and a couple other people who used to work on the show just drove all over the city of Los Angeles, delivering these things. Aziz is in England, so we FedExed him one.\n\nPaul Rudd was a very late addition to the show. Originally we shot Amy and Nick doing that intro where they explained that this is a fundraiser. And it was lovely and great, but the problem was that it was kind of a bummer to see, “Hi, I'm Amy Poehler.” “Hi, I'm Nick Offerman.” And then you dip to black and you come up and they're there again, but they're playing characters instead of themselves. So we were like, “Well, who else could we get that would be really fun to see?,” and very quickly thought of Paul — and very quickly shot him the joke that he just has no idea what's going on. [Laughs]\n\nWe texted him and said like, “Hey, would you be up for this?” And he said, Sure!” But he's on the East Coast, he's not here. So we were like, “Okay, we only have a day to do this, so we can FedEx you this rig and then you would get it tomorrow.” And he's like, “I have an iPhone! I have a little microphone. Let me just do it and see if it's okay.” I wrote a script for him, I emailed it to him, and then an hour later, he was like, “Here!” He had just done it. And it was incredible. So, the logistics were bananas, but also this group of people is so chill and so game for anything and so happy to do stuff like this that it ended up being about as smooth as it could possibly have been.\n\nImage zoom D Dipasupil/FilmMagic\n\nParks has one of the deepest, richest, and funniest rosters of tertiary characters milling about Pawnee, reminiscent of Springfield and The Simpsons. How did you go about deciding who could fit into the special? And did any scheduling issues prevent you from getting someone you wanted?\n\nA lot of it was like, “Look, we're doing a COVID-19 episode.” So that means there is only a certain amount of deeply insane people that you can have. We really wanted Mantzoukas (as Dennis Feinstein) because we came up with the joke that he invented a cologne that he was advertising as a virus-killing cologne. That, by the way, was written two weeks before the president had made that suggestion—\n\nThat was my next question! Given the timing on when this was filmed, I wondered if it was just one of those weird Parks-predicts-the-future jokes.\n\nIt was absolutely that. I mean, we wrote it because even at the time, it was more a reference to hydroxychloroquine, where it was like, “We have a new drug! Great! Everyone take this drug!” And then doctors being like, “Well, shouldn't we maybe just check out what happens when you take it?” And people are going, “No, no, no! It's great! Take it! Everyone eat this drug!” That's what that was in reference to. But it's obviously a much more direct analog to “inject bleach into your lungs.” So that was wild.\n\nWe knew we wanted Mantzoukas. We really wanted Mo Collins and Jay Jackson because we had that whole media thing. There were other people that we talked about potentially, but we basically only reached out to the people who were in it because those were the first people that we thought fit. And at the end of the day, there's 50 other people that I wish could have been in it. I wish we'd had an idea for Billy Eichner [a.k.a. Crag Middlebrooks] and Henry Winkler [Dr. Sapperstein] and so many other people who are a part of the show. It’s already three-and-a-half minutes longer than the average episode was, so there were only so many people we could wedge in there.\n\nThe Pawny Popsicle Lick-N-Pass being canceled is a glorious wink at the bizarro water-fountain-sucking ways of this town and its questionable hygiene. I am curious about all the pitches for that joke. Did you have a great run of alts to choose from?\n\nNo, honestly, there were none. And part of the reason there were none is because our original idea was that they would say, “How is Pawnee doing?” And then Jerry/Garry/Larry would say, “Not so great. Um, as you may remember, people in Pawnee don't have the best hygiene habits.” And then we were just going to slice in that actual scene from that episode as just a little reminder of how hard it would be to be the mayor of a town during a global viral pandemic when that's how people treat water fountains. So that's how we wrote it originally. But then it was like, “We've seen that already. That's not an interesting or surprising, so we ought to write a new joke.” And someone immediately pitched the Pawnee Popsicle Lick-N-Pass, and it was like, “Yep, that's it! Let’s not question it. Just keep going.” [Laughs]\n\nThe special’s most emotional and joyous moment is when the whole gang sings “5,000 Candles in the Wind.” You got files from each actor singing the song. Who sang it best?\n\nThey all had to sing it individually, and then our editor, Matt Freund, had to make it all line up, which was a heroic feat. Some of them had earpieces and were listening to the track to give them a sense of timing. And then others were doing it by memory or would listen to the track just to feel it for a second and then hit record and then record themselves singing it.\n\nRashida and Retta have the best voices in the cast, I would say. At various times they’ve both been professional singers, so it stands to reason. Amy's voice is great. She doesn't think of herself as a singer, but I think her voice is lovely. Pratt’s incredibly good at faking a rockstar voice, you know? He embodies a rock star. I feel like there's A Star is Born-type movie in his future because I don't think he has any vocal training at all, but he just understands how to sing somehow or how to like act like a singer. That’s really him singing and he sounded really good. He sounds gravelly and smoky and cool. They're all good. They're all super talented. When people are deeply talented, you can ask them to do anything and they'll just be able to do it. I feel like if I took three oranges and just threw them at Aubrey Plaza and said, “Juggle these,” she would just start juggling.\n\nI'd like to see that. Did you realize early on in the process that this would be the crowd-pleasing moment to end on, giving the special a feel-good, we’re-all-in-this-together uplift?\n\nThat was exactly it. We also thought, there's not a huge story in the episode. But what story there is is just Leslie’s frustration at not feeling connected to her giant group of friends because she can't see them and she can talk to them, but only one at a time. And everything's herky-jerky and you're constantly getting pulled away. So the natural conclusion for that story is that everybody gets together, and once they all get together, that just seemed like the right thing for them to do. I think I was inspired a little bit by some other things I've seen in the last six weeks. The thing that John Krasinski did on his Some Good News Show with having the whole cast of Hamilton sing that song to that girl. It's more fun to do something like share in a song together than it is to just all be on a screen yelling at each other, cross-talking and stuff. That was a thing that we had very early in the writing stage — at the end, they all get together, they all sing the song.\n\nWhat's the one joke that pained you to cut from the special?\n\nWe had a joke that Jamm was bragging about how much money he had made because right before everything went sideways, he sold his Porsche. And then right after that comes Jean-Ralphio’s ad and he says that he got hit by a Porsche. So it was utterly irrelevant, but it was always really fun to me to Jamm sold this Porsche and somehow that's the guy that hit Jean-Ralphio. [Laughs] Just a complete coincidence. When we watched it, it seemed like, “Is this misleading or is this confusing somehow? Do you think that Jamm hit him?” It didn't quite work, because it was a nonsense joke. It didn't mean anything and it wasn’t actually a part of any story, but it was just a funny thing that Matt Murray pitched, that Jamm should have just sold the Porsche that hit Jean-Ralphio. So Jamm made money by selling his Porsche and then Jean-Ralphio got money from being hit by the Porsche that was sold.\n\nImage zoom Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images\n\nWhat do you think it would've been like to continue writing Parks through this very ugly political landscape and right into where we are today? The show was always such a force of hopefulness and believing in the power of government and community for good...\n\nIt's not like the political landscape wasn’t ugly from 2008 to 2015. It was more traditionally ugly than it is now. Now it's a whole new kind of ugly. But part of the point of the show is that the experience of working in government is you get it from all sides. You get it from people who work within the government and want to destroy it. You get it from people who work within the government and are corrupt and they're cheating people out of resources and everything else. And you get it from citizens who were displeased with you for one reason, and citizens who were displeased with you for the entirely opposite reason. The point of the show was that the only answer was to put your head down and do your job and try to make people's lives better. So I don't know what it would have been like. I don't think it would have been very fun, honestly. If Parks and Rec was the right show for the era in which it was born and then played out, that probably means it would not be the right show for this time. Because it is a very different time. It's still ugly — it’s just ugly in a very different way than it used to be.\n\nBarring another pandemic, can you say that this special was the last time we'll see these actors as these characters, reading words that you wrote?\n\n[Laughs] Well, I guess I'll say what I said last time, which was: I'll never say never. Again, I really didn't think it was ever going to happen. But also suddenly it became a fun and neat thing to do. I have no idea. What was delightful and abundantly clear based on this experience is that the bat signal can go up for this group of people and they will answer the call. So, if there is another compelling reason to do this at some point down the road, then maybe it'll happen again.\n\nSpeaking of charity, you're also growing your Mose beard and pledging to wear this Jeter jersey to raise money for the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. [Schur matched all donations up to $50,000.]\n\nI am.\n\nWhat adjectives would you use to describe the state of the beard at this very moment, and is “mangy” one of them?\n\n“Mangy” is up there. “Patchy,” “awful,” “misery-creating.” “Sleep- depriving.” I find it hard to sleep because it itches so much. “Unattractive, “unappealing,” ummm, “marriage-threatening.” And “gross.” And “Brillo pad-dy.” And “virus-grabbing.” [Laughs] “Matted” would be one. “Food-catching.” And “slimy.” And “damp.” And “unpleasant.”\n\nWow, that was amazing. By the way, how's the Good Place reunion special coming along?\n\nIt's almost done. It’s just Derek [Mantzoukas] and Mindy St. Claire [Maribeth Monroe], in what amounts to their own self-quarantine in the Medium Place — for eternity. [Laughs]\n\nRelated content:"}

We’re now roughly seven weeks into social distancing and this “new normal” has just become the regular normal, all part of our new routine. For me, and many others, that routine includes tuning into all the late-night shows’ at home editions for a few laughs in the evening.\n\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said for all Americans. While I and the late-night hosts have adapted, the medical professionals on the front lines of fighting Covid-19 aren’t afforded the same luxury. The doctors, nurses, and first responders “new normal” is a routine that, frankly, most of us can’t fathom. Not to mention the millions of essential workers risking their own health day in and day out.\n\nSo, as the late-night shows have settled in, I’m sure glad many took time to recognize the incredible work being done by these brave people.\n\nThe biggest clip of the week, maybe even the year for the long-running NBC show, happened on Saturday Night Live at Home. Brad Pitt hosted the show with an instant classic cold open; The Oscar winner portrayed America’s favorite infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nThe casting was actually dreamed up by Dr. Fauci himself! While doing an interview with CNN’s New Day Fauci was playfully asked which actor he’d like to see portray him if and when SNL included him in a sketch. It was bound to happen eventually given his sudden household name status and close proximity to President Trump.\n\nWhile Pitt delivered the impersonation impeccably, the best moment came when the sketch was over. In a truly unprecedented move, the actor removed his glasses and grey-haired wig. Costume set aside, Pitt spoke directly to the camera saying, “thank you to the medical workers, first responders, and their families, for being on the front line.”\n\nJimmy Kimmel also took time to honor TJ Riley, a nurse at the Jacobi Medical Center in The Bronx, NY who also battled the disease himself. As part of the show’s “Healthcare Hero of the Week,” segment Kimmel surprised Riley with a video call from Foo Fighters’ frontman, David Grohl.\n\nMan, did the clip pull at my heartstrings when Grohl played an acoustic version of “Everlong” while photos and videos of nurses from across the country appeared on screen. Not gonna lie, I teared up! And the look on Riley’s face, obviously a huge fan, was so moving.\n\nOn The Late Show with Stephen Colbert this week, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobachar described her husband, John’s, harrowing experience with COVID-19 which included a 5-6 day hospital stay. She, too, spoke highly of the doctors and nurses on the front lines. “You wanna hug those healthcare workers, and you can’t. They’re the ones that are holding the phone up by his ear,\" she shared.\n\nThe late-night shows have always been meant to entertain us, and they still do during their at-home broadcasts – even more so, in some ways! The confinement has made the shows reach out of the box for creativity.\n\nIt’s been such a welcome breath of fresh air! But I am very grateful the hosts and celebrity guests haven’t lost sight of the true heroes behind this pandemic.\n\nWatch EW's new daily series, Last Night's Late Night, every morning on Quibi.\n\nRelated content:"}

Once upon a time, he was the showrunner of both The Office and Parks and Recreation simultaneously, and he’s back to his old tricks with two new streaming comedies set to launch in May. Daniels reunited with his Office star Steve Carell for Netflix’s Space Force, which they co-created together. “Steve called me in 2018 and said, ‘Hey, you want to do this show with me? I’ve got two words: Space Force.’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, cool!’ [Laughs] And we pitched that really fast and sold it without a script.” If only Upload could have been that easy.\n\nOn Friday, Daniels’ new afterlife comedy will premiere on Amazon Prime Video two years after the pilot was shot, three years after Amazon greenlit the first episode, five years after Daniels initially sold it to HBO, 12 years after he wrote it as a book (he cites Harry Potter as an influence at this time), and more than 30 years after he came up with the idea while brainstorming sketches at Saturday Night Live. \"If we go all the way back to when Greg thought it up, we were babies,\" Robbie Amell jokes of him and costar Andy Allo. \"The interesting thing about shooting it over the last couple years is that some of the things that Greg predicted on the show have come true, and, sadly, it will look like art imitating life, but really it was life imitating art.\"\n\nPart of the delay in Upload coming to life for viewers was what Daniels describes as a \"very complicated\" special effects process, which he previously didn't have much experience with, considering he believes they only did one VFX shot in the entire run of The Office. \"It reminds me of animation — but it's more expensive,\" cracks the King of the Hill co-creator. \"Sometimes it’s hard in Hollywood to do something different than what you’ve done in the past. I was pretty insistent that I thought this should be very cinematic and have a lot of different tones in it.\"\n\nOnce Daniels finally got the project going at Amazon, he cast Amell and Allo as the two leads of his ensemble. Both drawn to Upload by the presence of Daniels, they were the first (Amell) and last (Allo) people to audition. \"You hear Greg Daniels and you’re like, 'Okay, great, I’ll play a tree. I’m in,'” says Amell, who is best known for starring as Ronnie Raymond on The Flash. \"I’ve been really lucky to work with two incredible Gregs in Greg Daniels and [Arrowverse mastermind] Greg Berlanti, who are both at the top of their game and so successful and smart and funny. But the other thing they have in common is that there’s no ego, which is really special for someone who has had so much success.\"\n\nImage zoom Katie Yu/Amazon Studios\n\nSet in a technologically advanced future where humans can be \"uploaded\" into a virtual afterlife as they approach death, Amell stars as Nathan, a young app developer who must make his choice after a self-driving car accident. Pressured by his shallow girlfriend, he's uploaded to Lakeview, her family's beautiful mountain hotel digital extension. It's there where he's connected with his \"Angel,\" Nora (Allo), who, despite still being alive, serves as the customer service guide through his new life. \"Nora really just fit like a glove,\" says Allo, a musician and Pitch Perfect 3 alum. \"She has such a big heart, and I instantly connected to that and her dedication to taking care of her Lakeview clients.\" For Nathan, Amell says he saw similarities to his character in The DUFF, \"a guy who I think innately has a good heart, but is a little shallow and a little bit of a brat.\"\n\n\"Because she’s in the real world and he’s in upload, it takes some of the stress off of it being a romantic relationship\" shares Amell of the evolving connection between the characters. \"They can become friends before anything else happens. It’s not quite Romeo and Juliet, but it’s a relationship that isn’t supposed to be able to work, so there’s no pressure. They can really be themselves around each other, and I think it’s beautiful.\"\n\nAllo promises that Upload will provide some comedy, mystery, romance, and \"awesome tech and sci-fi\" all wrapped into one, but it also will make you think about your own ideal afterlife. \"I would absolutely love to upload and just be on permanent vacation,\" says Allo. \"Mine would be more of a Caribbean vibe, with just like white sandy beaches, pure crystal blue water.\" Amell interrupts, \"You're back on the beach again?\" He references her previously wanting to upload to a Persian vacation. \"You just want to travel!\" She fires back at his plan to upload to Lakeview and work there to keep busy. \"You're kind of in a retirement home there,\" he explains, \"so I'd want to find something do and not get too bored.\"\n\nDaniels doesn't have to think about his choice — he's already built it. \"The show is set in my preferred choice of afterlife,\" he says. \"Part of my goal is try and get Amazon to actually get into this business in time to have it ready for me. And that maybe they would give it to me for free because I gave them the idea.\"\n\nMaybe come season 2 renegotiations?\n\nHe laughs. \"I should put that in the contract.\"\n\nRelated content:"}

Ryan Murphy gives his nostalgic, sun-soaked ode to the 1940s studio system a welcome dollop of contemporary progressivism, literally rewriting history. Young stars, including Jeremy Pope, Darren Criss, Laura Harrier, and David Corenswet, chase their dreams while marginalized Hollywood insiders, played by the likes of Patti LuPone, Joe Mantello, and Jim Parsons, seek to give them a leg up the ladder (or the Hollywood sign as it were). “We learn from Hollywood how to dress, love, act. It’s always been that way,” explains Murphy. “If somebody back then would have been making pictures about gay people and people of color, I think it would have changed the fabric of America.” How’s that for a Hollywood ending? —Maureen Lee Lenker\n\nRelated content:\n\nUpload\n\nHOW/WHEN & WHERE TO WATCH: Streaming on Amazon Prime Video\n\nSeries Debut\n\nAfter previously serving as showrunner on both The Office and Parks and Recreation, Greg Daniels is going from Scranton and Pawnee to the afterlife with his new Amazon comedy Upload.

He’s soon connected with his \"Angel,\" Nora (Andy Allo), who, despite still being alive, serves as the customer service guide through his new life. There is plenty fun to be had in this world (tune in for the sexsuits and talking dogs), but Daniels says he didn’t want to make it a perfect heaven-like situation. “I’ve always thought it would be dangerous to invent some artificial intelligence smarter than us,” he tells EW. “To me, that’s something that I had to tell the crew when we were shooting. I was saying, 'this is not a dystopia and it’s a not a utopia, it’s like a comedy version where there’s the promise of utopia but then there’s constant unintended consequences and glitches and draw backs for comedy’s sake,' which is pretty much how I imagine it would happen in real life when we get there.” —Derek Lawrence\n\nRelated content:\n\nWhat Else to Watch\n\nStreaming\n\nTrying (series debut) — Apple TV+\n\nGhostwriter (part 2/season finale) — Apple TV+\n\nProp Culture (series debut) — Disney+\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars — Disney+\n\nHarley Quinn — DC Universe\n\nInto the Dark: Delivered — Hulu\n\nThe Half of It (movie) — Netflix\n\nCracked Up: The Darrell Hammond Story — Netflix\n\nAll Day and a Night (movie) — Netflix\n\nReckoning (series debut) — Netflix\n\nArkansas (movie) — Digital/VOD\n\nEndings, Beginnings (movie) — Digital/VOD\n\nTammy's Always Dying (movie) — Digital\n\n8 p.m.\n\nThe Blacklist — NBC\n\nCharmed (season finale) — The CW\n\nMacGyver — CBS\n\nRuPaul's Drag Race — VH1\n\nShark Tank — ABC\n\n9 p.m.\n\n20/20 — ABC\n\nMagnum P.I. — CBS\n\nDynasty — The CW\n\nDateline — NBC\n\nLionsgate Live!

The current season has only eight episodes, unlike the previous two.

Dolores’ (Evan Rachel Wood) mysterious master plan versus humanity is seemingly about to be finally unveiled as she sets disgruntled ex-soldier Caleb (Aaron Paul) on a path to radically change the world, while Dolores’ rival Maeve (Thandie Newton) and her rogue doppelgänger Haloros (Tessa Thompson) seemingly plot to stop her plans. The one thing we know for sure is that some season-long mysteries will be solved, and you can bet the ending will set up some intriguing new ideas for the already greenlit season 4 (Which will be set in space, right?

As usual, it's hard to know what to expect from this perpetually expectation-defying series, but the batch of episode titles (and this teaser) offer some hints. From the looks of it, riffs on Prometheus and Star Wars are on the way, as well as an installment called \"The Vat of Acid Episode.\" (The creative team seems determined to critique every sci-fi/fantasy trope in the book at this point.) It will be a tough job topping December's midseason finale, the season's high point so far, in which a space snakebite led to a dizzying time-travel misadventure. But like we said, defying expectations is kind of what Rick and Morty does. —Tyler Aquilina\n\nRelated content:\n\nWhat Else to Watch\n\nStreaming\n\nWe Cook Together Weekend — Food Network Kitchen app\n\n8 p.m.\n\nCBS Sunday Movie Night: Raiders of the Lost Ark — CBS\n\nBatwoman — The CW\n\nThe Simpsons — Fox\n\nThe Wall — NBC\n\nOutlander — Starz\n\n90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days — TLC\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nDuncanville — Fox\n\n9 p.m.\n\nSupergirl — The CW\n\nGood Witch (season premiere) — Hallmark\n\nBelgravia — Epix\n\nBob's Burgers — Fox\n\nKilling Eve — BBC America/AMC\n\nZoey's Extraordinary Playlist (season finale) — NBC\n\nVida — Starz\n\nThe Last Dance (eps 5-6) — ESPN\n\n9:30 p.m.\n\nFamily Guy — Fox\n\n10 p.m.\n\nInsecure — HBO\n\nThe Rookie — ABC\n\nGood Girls (season finale) — NBC\n\nPenny Dreadful: City of Angels — Showtime\n\n10:30 p.m.\n\nRun — HBO\n\n*times are ET and subject to change"}

This means that though the events of the show take place in Gotham City, Batman (Diedrich Bader) only shows up once in a while. The Dark Knight has been even more absent from the proceedings in season 2 since the season 1 finale left him comatose amid the devastation inflicted on Gotham by the Joker (Alan Tudyk). That all changes with this week's episode, which focuses entirely on Batman. The episode begins by poking fun at fanboys — as you can see in the exclusive clip above.\n\nThe upcoming episode is titled \"Batman's Back Man,\" and the cold open is a rare meta moment for Harley Quinn. It features two DC fanboys, clad in shirts referencing infamous fandom brouhahas from the last couple years and debating whether they should watch the new episode of Harley Quinn on their TV's DC Universe app. One of them, dressed in a \"Release the Snyder Cut\" shirt, disdains the show as material for \"12-year-old girls,\" despite a pretty in-depth knowledge of recent plot developments. The other, dressed in a shirt declaring \"The Last Jedi Is Not Canon,\" points out that he watched all five seasons of Gotham and didn't seem to have a problem with their loose approach to adaptation. Between that and the fact that Rise of Skywalker actually did invalidate most of the plot points from The Last Jedi, he seems to be the smarter of the two.\n\nWatch the clip above.

(0:53)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Titans declined to pick up the fifth-year option for wide receiver Corey Davis, sources confirmed to ESPN on Friday.\n\nThe fifth-year option would have carried a $15.68 million salary for Davis in 2021.\n\nNFL Network was first to report that the option would not be picked up.\n\nIn three seasons with the Titans, Davis, the No. 5 overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft, has 142 receptions for 1,867 yards and six touchdowns. In 2019, he scored two touchdowns during the regular season -- one each from quarterbacks Marcus Mariota and Ryan Tannehill -- and another in the playoffs against the Baltimore Ravens on a pass from running back Derrick Henry.\n\nTannehill said on a conference call last week with the local media that he would like to get Davis more opportunities this season.\n\n\"I definitely think my chemistry will grow with Corey this year. Such a talented guy,\" Tannehill said. \"Looking forward to building on what we started last year and our rapport, and looking forward to him making some big plays for us because I know he has the talent. I've seen him make the plays. Really excited to see him just keep growing and make those plays in 2020.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Titans will exercise the fifth-year option for cornerback Adoree' Jackson, a source told ESPN. By exercising the option, the Titans guarantee Jackson's contract for injury only in 2021 and his salary will be approximately $10.24 million -- the average of the third- through 25th-highest salaries at his position.\n\nJackson, the 18th overall pick in the 2017 draft, has started 39 games over the past three seasons, along with five playoff starts. The fourth-year player has two interceptions and 33 passes defended over his career.\n\nA foot injury kept him out of the final four regular-season games last season, but Jackson returned to start three playoff games and had five passes defended in the postseason.\n\nThe Titans could look for Jackson to assume a more significant role in the secondary this season. The likely loss of veteran cornerback Logan Ryan to free agency creates a void in nickel packages for the Titans, and general manager Jon Robinson has said he is open to the idea of possibly using Jackson in that spot at times."}

We invented the role.\"\n\nThe Saints originally did not have a seventh-round pick. In fact, they didn't have any picks in Rounds 4-7 after trading up to select Dayton tight end Adam Trautman at the end of Round 3.\n\nSo they spent most of their Saturday trying to identify and recruit the undrafted rookies they wanted to sign. Stevens was high on their priority list. He became even more of a priority once they found out Stevens had agreed to join the Panthers if he wasn't drafted.\n\nStevens had previously worked with new Panthers offensive coordinator Joe Brady when Brady was a graduate assistant at Penn State. And Brady, of course, used to work as an offensive assistant with the Saints -- which added to the intrigue of this bidding war.\n\n\"It became my project,\" said Payton, who said the Saints first offered to match Carolina's offer (a $15,000 signing bonus and $30,000 of Stevens' salary guaranteed).\n\nThen Payton said the Saints tried upping the offer to $144,000 of the salary guaranteed. But Stevens and agent Buddy Baker didn't budge because Stevens wanted to honor his commitment to Carolina.\n\nSo the Saints decided to outflank the Panthers by trading their 2021 sixth-round pick to the Houston Texans for a seventh-rounder this year. They took Stevens with the 240th overall pick.\n\nAccording to Payton, he sent one text to Brady that said, \"Not so fast,\" and another to Stevens and Baker that said, \"I'm tired of asking. Now, I'm taking.\"\n\n\"There's a little bit of competitive juices flying between me and Sean about, 'We want this player. And we're not gonna let anybody take him from us. We're gonna take him from them,'\" Saints assistant general manager/college scouting director Jeff Ireland said on the team's daily podcast. Payton said he understood why Stevens wanted to honor his commitment to Carolina.\n\n\"I said, 'Honestly, I was having some fun,'\" Payton said. \"'You had given your word and I respect that. But we weren't going to lose you. You were going to become a Saint.'\"\n\nAfter the draft, Payton explained that the Saints see Stevens as both a developmental QB and someone they could use as a tight end or on special teams, much like they have used Hill in recent years.\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 235-pounder threw for 1,155 yards, 11 touchdowns and five interceptions during an injury-riddled season as a graduate transfer with Mississippi State last year. He ran for 381 yards and four TDs."}

Gassnola and financial planner Munish Sood were made in the sneaker company's answer to an amended complaint by Brian Bowen II, who alleges Adidas and others derailed his career by causing the NCAA to rule him ineligible.\n\nAdidas accused the cross-defendants of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act by committing wire fraud, conspiracy and fraud, and the shoe company is asking for damages, forfeiture, attorney's fees and court costs.\n\n\"Throughout Brian Bowen Jr.'s high school career, his father, Brian Bowen Sr., solicited and accepted money in return for promising that his son would play basketball for specific schools and programs,\" Adidas attorneys wrote in a filing in U.S. District Court in South Carolina last month. \"In each instance that Bowen Sr. took money for his son's services, Bowen Jr. in fact played or committed to play for a particular team.\n\n\"Some of the funds Bowen Sr. received were misappropriated from adidas America, Inc. (\"adidas\") as part of a larger scheme. In this scheme, former adidas employees and other individuals misappropriated funds to pay families of high school athletes, like Bowen Jr., in exchange for those athletes committing to play for certain schools and programs. The participants in this scheme did not act on behalf of adidas or for its interests. To the contrary, the participants worked together to submit, and cause to be submitted, fraudulent invoices to obtain funds from adidas.\"\n\nIn September 2017, Louisville officials ruled Bowen, from Saginaw, Michigan, ineligible after an FBI investigation uncovered that an Adidas employee and others conspired to pay his father $100,000 for him to sign with the Cardinals. After Bowen transferred to South Carolina, the NCAA ruled him ineligible for the 2018-19 season.\n\nBowen, 21, never played a game in college and wasn't selected in the 2019 NBA draft. He signed a two-way contract with the Pacers in July 2019. He played in five games for the Pacers this season.\n\nIn November 2018, Bowen sued Adidas, Gassnola, Sood, Adidas employees Chris Rivers and James Gatto, former Adidas consultant Merl Code and former NBA runner Christian Dawkins, alleging they violated the RICO Act by engaging in bribery, fraud and money laundering at the expense of his eligibility and athletic development.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Joseph Anderson Jr. in March rejected Adidas' argument that it was a \"victim\" of the alleged scheme because some of the fraudulent invoices, which allegedly covered up the illicit payments to Bowen's father, were approved by some of the company's top executives.\n\nBowen II's attorneys have alleged that Adidas America then-general manager Zion Armstrong, head of sports marketing Chris McGuire and director of finance Gerald Adams approved invoices. Armstrong was named president of Adidas North America in April 2018.\n\n\"Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, this Court finds that the Plaintiff has adequately pleaded that Adidas had knowledge of the true purpose of the invoices,\" Anderson wrote in his March ruling. \"This Court declines to accept, especially at this stage in the proceedings, Defendant Adidas' contention that it did not or could not know the true purpose of these funds because the invoices were not labeled as a 'bribe.'\"\n\nAdidas' attorneys fired back in their latest filing, alleging Bowen Sr. was the one who derailed his son's career.\n\n\"Bowen Sr. played a central role in this scheme, culminating in striking a $100,000 deal for his son to play basketball at the University of Louisville (\"UofL\"),\" Adidas attorneys wrote. \"Bowen Sr. negotiated the price for Bowen Jr.'s commitment to UofL, arranged for a campus visit, agreed to mischaracterize himself as an Amateur Athletics Union 'consultant' (even though he never had provided any such services), accepted a cash payment in a New Jersey office parking lot, and ultimately caused Bowen Jr. to commit to play at UofL.\n\n\"All along, Bowen Sr. knew the funds to be paid to him would be misappropriated from adidas. Bowen Sr. and his co-conspirators are liable to adidas for the injury to the company resulting from their fraudulent scheme, including the misuse of adidas's money to steer Bowen Jr. to UofL. Likewise, Plaintiff Bowen Jr.'s attempt to use the scheme perpetrated by his father and others as a basis for RICO claims against adidas must fail.\""}

(3:04)\n\nReigning NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo was up until the wee hours Wednesday night asking his Twitter followers, \"What was your biggest takeaway from the Jordan Documentary thus far?\"\n\nAfter receiving around 4,000 comments on the post, the Milwaukee Bucks superstar shared his response on Friday morning.\n\n\"My MJ takeaway from the Last Dance documentary is that chasing greatness is a life mission,\" he tweeted.\n\nAntetokounmpo hasn't been shy in his pursuit of greatness. In fact, during Milwaukee's Nov. 18 win at Chicago, with Jordan's No. 23 and Scottie Pippen's 33 dangling from the rafters of the United Center, he told ESPN: \"I definitely want to be one of the best players to ever play.\n\n\"I try to lock in and focus on what I've got to do. But yeah, previous years, like when I saw No. 23 -- and not just 23, when I saw 33 -- that was a guy I used to talk to a lot, Scottie,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"It definitely motivated me. [Chicago is] a great basketball city. It's a city that Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen played in, so I had that extra juice in me.\"\n\nAlthough the Bucks aren't hosting virtual team watch parties for the \"Last Dance\" docuseries, guys are certainly tuned in, as they were on pace to make franchise history as the NBA's top-ranked team before the suspension. Milwaukee guard George Hill said he puts his phone on \"do not disturb\" during the Sunday time slot when the documentary is playing on ESPN.\n\n\"I grew up down the street from there in Indianapolis, and that was kind of our big rival during those days, the Pacers-Bulls rivals,\" Hill said. \"I was a huge Jordan fan, and I think that was one of the reasons, outside of Allen Iverson, that I wanted to play this game. I wanted to be competitive and have that drive he did and the way he carried himself and the basketball player he was, I think as a kid, with our generation, that's who we looked up to on the court.\"\n\nMarvin Williams spent six seasons with the Jordan-owned Charlotte Hornets before signing with the Bucks in February. Williams is being exposed to a different side of Jordan -- Jordan the player -- through the film.\n\n\"Obviously, to know him personally, he's been very different as an owner than he was as a player,\" Williams said. \"He'll tell you that himself. He's much more laid-back now, I would say, than he was when he was a player, but it's been fun to watch.\"\n\nAt age 25, Antetokounmpo is entering his prime and seemingly in the running to win a second straight MVP award. Milwaukee GM Jon Horst is keeping that in mind while studying Jordan's career. Jordan didn't win his first title until age 28, during the 1990-91 campaign.\n\nAntetokounmpo wasn't even born until Dec. 6, 1994.\n\n\"You look at championship teams, and they have an average age of like close to 30, and then they have an average age of like 26, 27, 28 when they get to a conference finals,\" Horst said. \"You have guys like Michael Jordan, who I don't think actually ended up getting to the NBA Finals until he was [28] years old. So I think for our guys, for our organization and for fans in general just to watch kind of the evolution of a championship organization -- not just a single championship year or a team that had a great run, but a team that figures out how to become great and then sustains it over a long period of time and does some really special things. I think it's really an interesting story for people to watch.\"\n\nThe Bucks currently hold an NBA-best 53-12 record. Through 65 games of Jordan's 1997-98 championship team, the Bulls were 48-17.\n\nThe Bucks have won a league-high 36 games by double figures and 19 games by at least 20. Despite playing only 65 games, that's already more games than the Bulls won by double figures (34) or 20-plus points (10), per ESPN Stats & Information research. It was a different era, but the Bulls ranked just 17th in made 3-pointers per game by knocking down 3.8 per game. That's less than Khris Middleton and Kyle Korver make combined (4.1). The Bucks rank fifth by making 13.7 per game, but unlike the Bulls, Milwaukee hasn't experienced a championship celebration since 1971.\n\n\"We're not any different from a handful of teams in the NBA who feel like we can compete for a championship and are in that grouping of teams that want to be the last team standing,\" coach Mike Budenholzer said. \"So you can always watch and learn from the best and the greatest in our sport, and certainly the Bulls were very special. But those teams that have won championships, multiple championships, they've really established themselves in that sense, and right now in our league, in our organization, we're trying to be that team for this season and going forward, but we have a mentality that we really haven't done anything and that we want to be very hungry. We want to be very humble and really just have a lot of work to be done. So hopefully there's a good balance for us when we see and watch a great team like that.\""}

(3:05)\n\nThe sudden disappearance of sports will erase at least $12 billion in revenue and hundreds of thousands of jobs, an economic catastrophe that will more than double if the college football and NFL schedules are wiped out this fall by the coronavirus pandemic, an analysis conducted for ESPN shows.\n\nThe meltdown is a fraction of the crisis spreading across the country, but it is nonetheless historic, touching every sector of the $100 billion United States sports industry.\n\nFrom stadium authorities to youth sports complexes, from rec centers to global TV networks such as ESPN, the scale of devastation is only now coming into view. Some organizations, especially at the lower levels of sports, say they'll be lucky to survive. The pain is especially acute among the army of low-wage service workers who support pro and college sports and are now unemployed. The losses are draining tax revenue that helps support local services such as police and firefighters and contributes to the quality of everyday life in thousands of communities.\n\n\"As an economist, you stand back, you look at the carnage that's taking place -- dumbfounded, awestruck, mind-numbing,\" said Patrick Rishe, who directs the sports business program at Washington University in St. Louis. \"All of those phrases, they're all relevant because we just have never seen anything on this scale.\"\n\nAt ESPN's request, Rishe examined publicly available data to estimate the potential impact of the shutdown on the major pro leagues, the NCAA and youth sports. Emsi, a labor market analytics firm, worked with ESPN to provide estimates on sports-related jobs. In addition, ESPN interviewed economists, public officials, sports executives, concession workers, travel team organizers and others to assess the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on sports at all levels.\n\nRishe's analysis relies on assumptions that appear more remote with each passing day, such as the ability of Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer to salvage at least half their seasons with fans attending games. The analysis also assumes the NBA and NHL cancel the rest of their regular seasons and the playoffs are staged without fans. And that youth sports resume by July.\n\nThe numbers include everything from the price of a ticket and a hot dog to the money you spend taking your daughter to an out-of-state soccer tournament. For example, the crisis stands to wipe out more than $3.25 billion that fans would have spent on pro sports. It would erase nearly $371 million in wages -- approximately 20 million hours -- for ticket takers, beer vendors and other stadium and arena employees. At least $2.2 billion of national TV revenue would be lost, as well as up to $2.4 billion in tourism related to youth sports.\n\nTotaling the Damage Not including the fate of the upcoming football season, Patrick Rishe of Washington University in St. Louis breaks down the revenue losses from the sports stoppage like this: Pro*: $5.5 billion College: $3.9 billion Youth sports tourism: $2.4 billion *Assumes NBA and NHL cancel the rest of their regular seasons and MLB and MLS miss 50% of their seasons.\n\nThe analysis is conservative in a number of ways. It does not include projected losses from NASCAR, golf, tennis and several minor sports and gambling. The numbers also don't account for losses in the outdoor recreation industry, including hunting, skiing, recreational golf and tennis and fishing. Outdoor recreation generated $427 billion in 2017, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. With sporting goods stores, golf courses and fishing tournaments shut down in parts of the country, those revenues and jobs have disappeared, too.\n\nComplicating matters, insurance is unlikely to make up many of the losses. Although big events like Wimbledon and the Olympics held comprehensive insurance policies, the major U.S. sports leagues are not covered for the pandemic, in part because the loss of entire seasons was regarded as unthinkable, industry sources told ESPN.\n\n\"It's like hell began freezing over,\" one sports executive said.\n\nThe stakes for sports become higher if part or all of the NFL and college football seasons are lost. According to Rishe, each NFL regular-season game is worth nearly $24 million in revenue from TV rights alone -- a figure larger than the budget for some Hollywood films. Collectively, the 65 college football programs in the Power 5 bring about $4 billion in revenue -- money that makes up nearly half of all athletic department budgets.\n\n\"If [college] football goes down, that's just a killer,\" said Rick Gentile, a former CBS executive who still works in broadcasting and directs the Seton Hall University Sports Poll. \"I don't know how schools recover from that, God only knows. You could make a prediction, go crazy. The Pac-12 disbands? I'm making it up, but who knows?\"\n\nTourism associated with young athletes such as these Hartford (Connecticut) Little Leaguers accounts for a big chunk of the revenue sidelined by the pandemic. Brad Horrigan/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nAS WITH THE rest of the economy, job losses in sports are expected to be staggering. There are roughly 3 million jobs within 524 occupations that are dependent on sports, according to Emsi's analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's everybody from athletic trainers to security guards, from umpires to public address announcers, from groundskeepers to dancers. Analysts say many of these workers are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nFor example, there are 278,932 Americans who earn an average of $45,649 annually from coaching and scouting. There are 371,607 fitness and aerobics instructors, with an average annual salary of $44,956 -- representing nearly $17 billion in total wages.\n\nHow many of those people are out of work -- and when those jobs may return -- is not yet clear, but the effect on pro sports is already dramatic. It requires roughly 1,900 people to stage an NBA game, for example, according to league figures. Of the 52,450 workers the NBA supports, approximately 42,000 -- or 80% -- are ushers, security personnel, ticket takers and other service people working at arenas.\n\nAlthough teams and, in some cases, star athletes have pledged money to help those workers, the assistance will fall short of what's needed, especially if leagues such as the NBA and MLB return without fans. \"My worst fear is the startup -- coming back if the people are not attending games,\" said Tawanda Murray, 45, who works concessions at Chicago's United Center.\n\nOn March 11, Murray was working a Blackhawks game when she and her colleagues heard the NBA was shutting down. One day later, the NHL postponed its season. Murray immediately filed for unemployment.\n\nTHE POTENTIAL IMPACT on the $19 billion youth sports industry is even more profound and far-reaching. A survey commissioned by the Sports Events & Tourism Association, which represents the sports travel industry, found that nearly 700,000 athletes were unable to participate in scheduled events in March alone, costing organizers more than $700 million.\n\n\"Right now people are still in shock,\" said Al Kidd, the association's president and CEO.\n\nHundreds of organizations, including travel sports companies, Pop Warner Little Scholars and US Lacrosse, have petitioned Congress to create an $8.5 billion \"youth sports relief fund\" to \"stabilize the industry and invest in recovery.\"\n\nMany organizations may be fighting to remain solvent after their losses, and experts say everything from team travel to fan attendance will have to be reimagined when kids return to action\n\n\"Youth sports will not be the same following this pandemic,\" the letter stated.\n\nIn recent years, the youth market has emerged as the largest sports-revenue driver in the country.\n\nMunicipalities all over the country have engaged in an arms race to create \"megacilities\" -- multipurpose complexes that attract travel tournaments and tax revenue. The facilities have been built \"under the guise that this was for kids, but really the cities are after the tax money, let's be real about it,\" Kidd said. \"It grew to the point where it was like weeds springing up across America.\"\n\nNow, those facilities are idle.\n\nIn Westfield, Indiana, officials were forced to shut down the 400-acre Grand Park Sports Campus at the height of the spring season. The facility, about 30 miles north of Indianapolis, has 31 multi-purposes fields and hosts events year-round. Grand Park hopes to reopen June 1. Officials calculate that the central Indiana economy is losing more than $20 million per month while the facility is closed. Nearly a quarter of all hotel room reservations in Hamilton County are tied to the complex.\n\n\"I wouldn't hesitate to say this is devastating,\" said Brenda Myers, president of the Hamilton County Tourism Board, which is financed almost entirely by a lodging tax. Myers has cut her 24-member staff in half through layoffs and furloughs.\n\nIn Blaine, Minnesota, the $170 million, 660-acre National Sports Center lies dormant. Billed as \"The World's Largest Amateur Sports Facility,\" the complex includes 50 multi-use athletic fields, an ice arena with eight rinks, a stadium that seats 5,500 people and a 58,000-square-foot indoor facility. The NSC has calculated its annual economic impact to the community at $89.1 million.\n\nIn July, the NSC is scheduled to host the Target USA Cup, the largest amateur soccer tournament in the U.S. The tournament brings in 16,000 players from more than 20 countries, filling up almost every hotel room in the Twin Cities.\n\n\"It's potentially pretty devastating if [the pandemic] keeps going on,\" said NSC executive director Todd Johnson, whose organization is asking for donations on its website to stay afloat. \"My goal is to get us through the summer.\"\n\nSPORTS-RELATED TRAVEL -- to follow pro and college teams and to attend youth tournaments in communities such as Westfield and Blaine -- generated $32 billion in 2018, according to a study by Longwoods International, a market research company that specializes in travel and tourism.\n\n\"We love it when visitors come into our communities and spend tourism dollars,\" said Amir Eylon, the president and CEO of Longwoods. \"It helps broaden the tax base, it's helping to pay for my fire and police protection.\n\n\"The exponential loss to the economy is just mind-boggling.\"\n\nIn Cleveland, over a two-week period, the pandemic canceled the Mid-American Conference men's and women's basketball tournaments, the first and second rounds of the NCAA sub-regional, the NCAA Division II swimming and diving championships and the 2020 national title for the American Cornhole League, with 1,000 participants.\n\nDavid Gilbert, president and CEO of the Greater Cleveland Sports Commission, said the events were expected to bring in $12 million to $15 million in revenue for the city.\n\n\"The people working downtown are a skeleton crew. I'm one of them that isn't there,\" Gilbert said in an interview from his home. He estimated that up to 2,000 hotel and restaurant jobs in downtown Cleveland have disappeared.\n\n\"I would say a good portion of those are supported by those events,\" he said.\n\nIn Alabama, the pandemic has crushed the state's $1.4 billion freshwater fishing industry, including the popular Tournament Series of the Alabama Bass Trail. AnglersChannel.com\n\nIn Alabama, the pandemic has crushed the state's $1.4 billion freshwater fishing industry, which includes the popular Tournament Series of the Alabama Bass Trail, with anglers coming from around the country to participate in 10 events plus a championship.\n\n\"Everything has fallen like dead leaves,\" said Kay Donaldson, director of the Alabama Bass Trail.\n\nThe loss of four tournaments so far has canceled about 1,400 nights of hotel reservations.\n\n\"So, those people aren't staying in those hotel rooms, eating at restaurants, driving over to the local pub,\" Donaldson said. \"They're not putting gas in their truck, they're not putting gas in their boat, so there's a big trickle down.\n\n\"Bass fishing to several of our communities is a really big deal.\"\n\nUNTIL NOW, SPORTS were thought by many to be recession-proof. A 2019 report by PwC predicted robust annual growth through at least 2023 and gushed: \"The love affair with sports in the United States is a perpetual and immersive force.\"\n\nBut the pandemic has undermined the most basic assumptions about sports economics.\n\nMany economists believe that sports has little impact on the overall economy because of a \"substitution effect.\" The theory is that fans seek out alternate forms of entertainment if, for example, a league goes on strike or a team moves to another city.\n\n\"In COVID-19, that issue is turned on its head,\" said Victor Matheson, a professor at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. \"The money that is not being spent on the NBA, that's true loss, because it's not being made up anywhere else.\"\n\nThe sports betting market is one of many examples. Since 2018, when the Supreme Court struck down a law that limited sports betting primarily to Nevada, more than $20.5 billion has been wagered in the 16 states that were taking bets prior to the pandemic, generating $180 million in tax revenue, according to legalsportsreport.com, which tracks the industry. PwC called gambling \"the most significant catalyst shaping today's sports market.\"\n\nSports began to disappear on the eve of the NCAA tournament, an event that gaming officials estimate generated a record $400 million in wagers last year for Nevada sportsbooks. On March 12, as conference tournaments shut down, the odds provider Don Best Sports issued a series of \"critical alerts\" to its bookmaker clients that signaled the industry's imminent collapse. When March was over, approximately $141.2 million had been bet at Nevada books -- a 76% year-over-year decrease and the lowest amount bet in the month of March since 1993.\n\nThese days, hours sometimes pass without sportsbooks taking a single bet. Russian table tennis -- one of a handful of niche events still standing -- has emerged as one of the most popular betting markets at William Hill U.S. Sportsbook.\n\n\"We went from one of our busiest times to basically nothing,\" said Alan Berg, a senior oddsmaker for Caesars Sportsbook in Las Vegas.\n\nESTIMATES FOR HOW much of the sports economy ultimately will disappear are as elusive as mapping out the trajectory of the disease. The NBA, MLB, the NFL and other leagues are developing contingency plans to salvage what they can, including locking down players in a kind of sterilized biosphere. That strategy would not only bring back sports but also would help leagues capture billions of dollars in TV rights fees, the largest driver of sports revenue.\n\nBut at this point, no one has any idea what will work. And even if the leagues and colleges find ways to resume, the losses will be massive without fans spending on everything from parking to garlic fries to their favorite player's jersey.\n\nTo calculate the financial impact of the pandemic, Rishe examined publicly available data from several sources. That included Team Marketing Report's Fan Cost Index, which measures fan spending; a study on the youth sports market developed by WinterGreen Research, an international forecasting company; pro sports media data from Sports Business Journal's \"Resource Guide Live;\" and others.\n\nRishe acknowledged several caveats to his calculations, but most suggested the numbers were conservative. If Major League Baseball plays without fans for even half the season, for example, more than $2 billion in fan game-day spending -- tickets, food, merchandise and other items -- will be lost.\n\nThe absence of fans also means most of the workforce that supports the major sports will be unemployed.\n\nTo calculate the impact on labor in pro sports, Rishe took the average number of temporary service employees required to staff NBA, NHL and MLB games. Because some employees work for multiple teams -- the Lakers and Clippers, for example -- and even at multiple venues, it was impossible to estimate the number of workers actually unemployed.\n\nRishe instead examined lost wages. He calculated that workers will lose 19.5 million hours totaling more than $370 million. Those wages were based on both part-time workers employed by the teams and contract workers employed by food-service companies such as Aramark and Levy, which, according to their union representatives, average roughly $14 per hour. Rishe estimates each MLB team employs nearly 2,300 temp workers per game.\n\n\"Some people think this is like pocket change or work for folks in high school or college. It's not,\" said Rosslyn Wuchinich, president of UNITE HERE Local 274, which represents 2,500 concession workers at 76ers, Flyers and Eagles games in Philadelphia. \"These are people supporting families on this income.

(2:36)\n\nWith NFL facilities shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Seattle Seahawks are holding video conferences in lieu of in-person meetings that would normally take place at the suburban Virginia Mason Athletic Center in Renton, Washington.\n\nCoach and noted prankster Pete Carroll, whose team began its virtual offseason program this week, wanted to introduce some of the incoming Seahawks to their new teammates during Thursday's meeting.\n\nThat was the setup for a gag that had comedian/actor Will Ferrell impersonating veteran tight end Greg Olsen, who signed a one-year, $7 million contract with Seattle in February.\n\nIt begins with \"Olsen\" sharing his deep affection for Russell Wilson, telling the quarterback: \"I mean, I love you. Let's make a baby.\"\n\nHe makes it clear to offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer that he didn't come to Seattle to block and shows off one of his own hand-drawn plays, \"90 go flywheel Kanye starburst.\"\n\nHe won't play special teams under any circumstances, nor will he stand for any nonsense from one of his fellow tight ends, the fun-loving and long-haired Luke Willson.\n\n\"Tamp that s--- down, OK,\" he tells Willson. \"That's not how I handle myself, all right? I don't know what you do in the offseason up there in Canada, but cut your god damn hair and let's play some football.\"\n\nThe real-life Olsen has made three Pro Bowls and caught 59 touchdown passes in 13 NFL seasons, including the past nine with the Carolina Panthers. He has gotten a head start on his post-football career by serving as a color analyst on Fox broadcasts of some NFL games, most recently last season during Carolina's bye.\n\nImpersonating Olsen, Ferrell thanks Carroll for allowing him to broadcast Seahawks games and play in them at the same time. Then he tries to allay teammates' concerns about his age by assuring them he has been staying in shape with an all-yoga exercise plan.\n\n\"Does this look like the body of a 36-year-old?\" he says while pulling up his shirt to expose a flabby midsection. \"I don't think so.\"\n\nCarroll and Ferrell go back to the coach's days at USC, where Ferrell was a fixture around the Trojans football program."}

In 2020, some teams took advantage, particularly the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nDecades after its creation, it seems that the famous Jimmy Johnson draft value chart is still the benchmark for most teams. Of all the pick-for-pick trades in the 2020 NFL draft, only one deviated from the chart by more than 50 points.\n\nThe issue is that the Johnson chart does not reflect the reality of expected production from draft picks. As others have done before, we created our own chart using Pro Football Reference's Approximate Value (AV). ESPN's sports analytics specialist, Brian Burke, ran a regression on the actual per-year AV for each draft slot over the first four years of a player's career to get an expected AV for each slot. The conclusion is the same as from similar analyses: Early picks are overvalued by the Johnson chart, and later picks are undervalued.\n\nThis is how teams such as the Vikings gain capital through trades generally along the lines of the Johnson chart. By recognizing the uncertainty in the draft, teams maximize their chances of success by trading early picks for more bites at the apple. The Johnson chart isn't always off the mark -- the Patriots and Ravens made a trade that was even by both the old chart and ours -- but it often is.\n\nOne small change for our chart since last year: We've added a replacement level worth the value of the last pick of the draft. In other words, instead of comparing the value of the expected production of each pick, we're measuring the marginal expected production of each pick over the last pick in the draft. After thinking about it, we realized that the former overvalued an accumulation of many late-round picks, which are barely worth more than undrafted free agents. The change didn't flip the direction of the surplus value in any trades in this draft, but it did lessen the degree of the surplus value in some instances.\n\nLet's break down the five best pick-for-pick trades from draft weekend, along with a bonus deal that was offered but not completed. We'll rank them by how much extra value the winning team gained, compared to how much it gave up. For the sake of this exercise, we have assumed that 2021 picks will be in the middle of the round and, somewhat arbitrarily, deemed them worth 90% of the value of a 2020 selection."}

However, the digital launch will go ahead as originally planned.\n\nIn a statement, The Wonderful 101: Remastered team announced that the new physical release date for the game is now June 30 in North America and July 3 in Europe.The digital release date for The Wonderful 101 remaster is still set for May 19 in North America and May 22 in Europe.Original story follows.\n\nLoading\n\nThe Wonderful 101: Remastered Kickstarter 8 IMAGES\n\nPlatinumGames has announced The Wonderful 101: Remastered will be released for Nintendo Switch, PS4 and Steam on May 19 in North America and May 22 in Europe (no Australian release date available at time of writing).This is being referred to as a \"general\" release date and, to our knowledge, backers of the game's Kickstarter that paid to receive a copy of the game will still be receiving it in April as stated on the crowd-funding campaign's page In a message to fans, the original version's director, Hideki Kamiya, thanked fans for supporting the game after its commercial failure on Wii U, saying, \"I’m considering this a chance to show it to the world again. I’m looking forward to seeing how it measures up.\"He adds: \"This isn’t just a simple port, either. We’ve tuned the controls for each new platform and made several adjustments that should make it easier to grasp and play.

A bulletin board post will remind players a few days before the event begins.\n\nHow to Get a May Day Ticket [ edit ]\n\nLoading\n\nDuring the May Day Event, head to the Resident Services building and speak to Tom Nook to learn about a themed May Day Ticket that can be used at the airport. Unlike Nook Miles Tickets, this ticket will allow you to travel to a special themed island that cannot be accessed normally.\n\nOnce you've talked to Tom Nook, head to the airport and you'll find that Orville is holding a special May Day Ticket with your name on it! When speaking with him, be sure to ask to use that ticket to fly.\n\nNote that due to the nature of the island, you will not be able to bring any items, resources, or tools with you.\n\nMay Day Maze Guide - How to Reach Rover [ edit ]\n\nThe May Day Island Tour is a specially crafted maze that takes up the entire space of the main island (excluding beaches), and rocks will prevent you from accessing anything but the main part of the island.\n\nSince you will not have access to your own tools, your objective is to reach Rover on the other side of the island by navigating the winding maze and looking for items to help you progress past barriers. There are also special prizes waiting at the end for those who use items wisely! Read the step-by-step guide or view the slideshow below for information on how to complete the maze, and access hidden rewards!\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons - Rover's May Day Maze Guide 11 IMAGES\n\nadvertisement\n\nGrab the Shovel Ignore the bottom row of shrubs, and instead dig the shrub up to the left of the tree, and grab 1 fruit. Eat the fruit and dig up the first tree. Head up to jump two small gaps, then take a left across another small gap to find 1 Tree Branch. Head down and right across two gaps to a series of holes with 3 tree branches, 1 stone, and a Worn Axe. The axe can only be used three times before it breaks, so don't use it in the wrong place! With the Worn Axe, jump back across the gap going up and left to the top left corner of the maze, where a tree blocks you from reaching a Tree Branch and two Fruit. Chop the tree down (your Axe will break), and collect 1 Tree Branch and 2 Fruit. Head right from where the tree was to the right side of the map to collect 3 Wood. Head back to the top left side of the maze, go down and right to the section where you collected three branches, and jump down across the left-most gap, then hop left to find a rock. Eat one of the two fruits, and break the rock with your Shovel, and collect 1 Iron Nugget on the other side. Do not waste your last fruit to dig up the tree here! You should have one fruit left. Instead, head back right, up, and left across a gap until you reach the middle of the maze, and jump right across the three gaps to reach another rock. Use the second Fruit to break the rock, then move down and grab 1 Fruit below it. You can use that fruit to dig up the tree at the bottom, which will let you reach the DIY Workbench. Craft a Flimsy Axe with the 5 Tree Branches and 1 Stone, and then an Axe with the 3 Wood and 1 Iron Nugget. You’ll need the upgraded Axe to progress! Return to the middle of the maze and chop down the tree to the left that blocks your access to 2 Fruit. Do not eat them yet! Move right across the three gaps, go up to the top right corner where you collected the wood, and then cross to the left side of the maze. Once at the top left side of the maze, move down and then right to return to where the row of three gaps are, and hop down across the left-most gap to get back to where you found the Iron Nugget. Now you can chop down this tree with your axe, and move up to gain another Fruit. You should now have three fruit in your inventory. Move up across the gap to find three trees in a row. If you want extra rewards do NOT eat the fruit yet, and chop the three trees down with your Axe. This path will now lead to Rover! Talk to him, and he'll reward you with the Rover's Briefcase item! To the left of Rover, look for some shrubs, and dig up the one on the left to reach 4 Bells Vouchers. Finally, instead of exiting the area via the bottom right, dig up the shrubs above the Bell Vouchers to find another path going around the top left and down to the bottom left. Here you will find 3 rocks that can only be broken with the 3 Fruit you collected earlier - as long as you didn’t use them to dig up the last three trees. This allows you to access 5 more Bell Vouchers! Dig up the shrubs along the bottom to get back to the start."}

It’s a lovely and engrossing ambient work built using field recordings of the endangered Indiana bats. Haven’t bats had it rough enough of late?\n\nIf you need further recommendations, 150 artists and labels are also participating in a number of different ways. Some, like Arts & Crafts, Kill Rock Stars, Sub Pop, Saddlecreek, Merge and Matador are also giving all of the revenue to artists. Others like Cloud Nothings, Deerhoof and my personal favorite, The Hold Steady, have released new material. Others still like Cooking Vinyl and Sufjan Stevens are giving proceeds to related charity.

So if you’re a YouTube creator hoping to capture some additional eyeballs while everyone’s stuck at home, online video agency Butter Works has released an interactive report outlining the most promising topics for you to focus on.\n\nCEO Paul Greenberg explained that the report is drawn from the ongoing analysis that Butter Works performs to guide companies’ strategies around video production and distribution. (The agency has done work for clients like Apple, Coca-Cola and Netflix.)\n\nIn this case, it was looking at which video topics were getting the most views and the most engagement from U.S. audiences — and then comparing the topics that are currently attracting audiences with the actual number of videos posted on YouTube in a given topic.\n\nThe ideal topic for a video creator, then, is one where there’s a lot of audience interest but not many videos (yet).\n\nSo what did Butter Works find? The report points to the biggest opportunities as cooking (especially budget meals), comedy (celebrity talk shows, skits pranks and parodies), memes (particularly boredom cures and K-pop), games (outdoor-to-indoor and group games) and video games (especially coronavirus-related).\n\nGreenberg added that this analysis is based on two recent weeks of audience behavior, and will be updated regularly.\n\n“Normally we’d look over a three-month time … but [given the current situation], we want to refresh it every two weeks,” he said. “I agree that it’s such a fluid situation right now, it’s changing pretty fast.”\n\nYou can see the full report, including recommendations about video length, on the Butter Works website."}

The iPhone, the longtime cornerstone of the company’s hardware portfolio, hit $28.96 billion in revenue for Q2, down from $31.1 billion from this time last year. The iPad and Mac lines saw drops for the quarter, as well.\n\nIn fact, a new Canalys report suggests that smartphone sales are down 13% globally.\n\n2. NVIDIA’s top scientist develops open-source ventilator that can be built with $400 in readily-available parts\n\nThe mechanical ventilator design developed by NVIDIA’s Bill Daily can be assembled quickly, using off-the-shelf parts with a total cost of around $400 – making it an accessible and affordable alternative to traditional, dedicated ventilators which can cost $20,000 or more.\n\n3. Amazon Q1 beats on net sales of $75.5B but posts net income of $2.5B, down $1B on a year ago\n\nThe company’s net sales were up 26% year-year-over. Of those sales, $41 billion was attributable to product sales and $33 billion to services (which includes AWS, but also streaming and other non-physical goods). CEO Jeff Bezos acknowledged the challenges the company is facing, but he also reiterated that it plans to double down on spending in Q2.\n\n4. Walmart is piloting a pricier 2-hour ‘Express’ grocery delivery service\n\nWalmart now hopes to capitalize on the increased demand for speedier delivery with the introduction of a new service that allows consumers to pay to get to the front of the line. The retailer confirmed today it’s launching a new Walmart Grocery service called “Express,” which promises orders in two hours or less for an upcharge of $10 on top of the usual delivery fee.\n\n5. 5 tips for starting a business with a stranger\n\nCo-founder and CEO Sam Pillar argues that his startup Jobber is proof that starting a company with a stranger isn’t just doable, it can even be an advantage.

There are still a couple of things remaining to finish up prior to flight, including a final parachute system test that’s happening later today. The company also posted a video recap of its most recent uncrewed Crew Dragon flight, the in-flight escape demonstration that it flew on January 19.\n\nThe video provides a look at the processes involved in the test, including a look at mission control, with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley looking on during the flight. You can see the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch with the Crew Dragon attached, as well as watch it explode in a ball of fire (as intended) during the early emergency separation. Then, watch as the capsule itself descends safety back to the ocean where it’s recovered by a SpaceX vessel.\n\nThis is a demonstration of a key system that’s designed as a safety measure, to be used only in the unlikely event of a major malfunction of the rocket during the takeoff phase, but after the spacecraft has left the ground. The system works by quickly and automatically propelling the astronaut-carrying Crew Capsule away from the booster and second stage at a very high speed, to ensure the people aboard are at a safe distance in case of any explosions.\n\nAlong with a ground escape system for quickly vacating the capsule and launch area before takeoff, there are a number of safety measures required by NASA for any human spaceflight from U.S. soil with astronauts on board. SpaceX has so far demonstrated that these systems are ready to a degree that has satisfied the agency, and now has only a number of pre-flight checks and run-throughs to get through before the historic May 27 mission."}

But it was the 2000s and everyone was in tech so Amin-Jahaveri figured that’d be his path too.\n\nThose two worlds collided for the young University of Washington graduate in his very first job — his only job before launching his first startup — as a programmer and developer at Chempoint.\n\n“Completely through happenstance I was walking around a certain part of Seattle and I walked by this building and it had all these logos outside the office. I saw this logo for a company called Chempoint and I was instantly intrigued,” Amin-Jahaveri said. “I walked up to the receptionist and asked what they were doing.”\n\nIn the summer of 2001, Amazon was an online bookseller a little over seven years old, the dot-com boom hadn’t gone completely bust quite yet and business-to-business marketplaces were a hot investment.\n\n“It was a startup with just a handful of folks,” said Amin-Jahaveri. “There wasn’t a business model in place, but the intent was to build a marketplace for chemicals… The dot-com boom was happening and everything was moving on line and the chemicals industry likely will as well.”\n\nFifteen years later, Chempoint is one of the last remaining companies in a market that once boasted at least fifteen competitors — and the chemicals industry still doesn’t have a true online marketplace. Until (potentially) now, with the launch of Amin-Jahaveri’s first startup — Knowde.\n\nFor the vast majority of Americans, the chemicals industry remains a ubiquitous abstraction. Consumers have a direct relationship with the energy business through the movements of prices at the pump, but the ways in which barrels of oil get converted into the plastics, coatings, films, flavors, fillings, soaps, toothpastes, enamels and unguents that touch everyone’s daily life are a little bit less obvious.\n\nIt’s a massive industry. The U.S. accounted for 17% of the global chemicals market in 2017 and that percentage amounted to a staggering $765 billion in sales. Worldwide there are thousands of chemicals companies selling hundreds of different specialty chemicals each and all contributing to a total market worth trillions of dollars.\n\n“The market is $5 trillion,” said Amin-Jahaveri. “Just to be super clear about that.. It’s $5 trillion worth of transactions happening every year.”\n\nIt’s no secret that venture capitalists love marketplaces. Replacing physical middlemen with electronic ones offers efficiencies and economies of scale that have a cold logic and avoid the messiness of human contact. For the past twenty years, different entrepreneurs have cropped to tackle creating systems that could connect buyers on one side with sellers on another — and the chemicals industry has been investors’ holy grail since Chempoint made its pitch to the market in 2001.\n\n“The chemicals industry is the most interesting of all of them. It’s the biggest. It’s also the most fragmented,” said Sequoia partner Shaun Maguire. “There were three companies in the world that all did about $90 billion in sales and none of those three companies did more than 1.6% of sales of the entire industry.”\n\nThose kinds of numbers would make any investor’s jaw drop. And several firms tried to make a pitch for the hotly contested financing round for Knowde. Maguire first heard that there looking for funds to pursue the creation of the first true marketplace business for the chemicals industry through a finance associate at Sequoia, Spencer Hemphill.\n\nHemphill knew an early Knowde investor named Ian Rountree at Cantos Ventures and had heard Rountree talk about the new company. He flagged the potential deal to Maguire and another Sequoia partner. It only took one hour for Maguire to be blown away by Amin-Jahaveri’s pedigree in the industry and his vision for Knowde.\n\nFrom that initial meeting in September to the close of the company’s $14 million Series A round on March 11 (the day the markets suffered their worst COVID-19-related losses), Maguire was tracking the company’s progress. Other firms in the running for the Knowde deal included big names like General Catalyst, according to people with knowledge of the process.\n\nSequoia wound up leading the Series A deal for Knowde, which also included previous investors Refactor Capital, 8VC, and Cantos Ventures.\n\nThe tipping point for Maguire was the rapid adoption and buy-in from the industry when Knowde flipped the switch on sales in early January.\n\nFor at least the past fifty years, the modern chemicals industry has been defined — and in some ways constrained — by its sales pitches. There are specialty manufacturers who have hundreds of chemicals that they’ve made, but the knowledge of what those chemicals can do is often locked inside research labs. The companies rely on distributors, middlemen, and internal sales teams to get the word out, according to Maguire and Amin-Jahaveri.\n\n“The way that things are done is still through field sales teams and product catalogs and brochures and face to face meetings and all that stuff,” said Amin-Jahaveri. “This industry has not evolved as quickly as the rest of the world… And we always knew that something has got to give.”\n\nOne selling point for Knowde is that it breaks that logjam, according to investors like Maguire.\n\n“One of the references said that they had a bunch of legacy flavors from the seventies,” Maguire said. “It was a Madagascar Vanilla that none of their sales people had tried to sell for 25 years… By putting them on Knowde the sales numbers had gone up over 1,000%… That company does over $5 billion a year in sales through flavors.”\n\nThe change happened as the old guard of executives began aging out of the business, according to Amin-Jahaveri. “Between 2002 and 2012 nothing happened.. There was no VC money thrown at any type chemical company and then it started changing a little bit,” he said. “The first domino was the changing age demographic… these consumer product companies kept getting younger.”\n\nAmin-Jahaveri’s previous company grew to $400 million in revenue selling technology and services to the chemicals industry. It was back-end software and customer relationship tools that the industry had never had and needed if it were to begin the process of joining the digital world. Knowde, according to Amin-Jahaveri, is the next phase of that transition.\n\n“Our plan is to connect the chemical producers directly with the buyers,” Amin-Jahaveri said. “And provide all the plumbing and storefronts necessary to manage these things themselves.”\n\nAll that Knowde needed to do was collate the disparate data about what chemicals small manufacturers were making and had in stock and begin listing that information online. That transparency of information used to be more difficult to capture, since companies viewed their product catalog as an extension of their intellectual property — almost a trade secret, according to Amin-Jahaveri.\n\nOnce companies began listing products online, Amin-Jahaveri and his team could go to work creating a single, searchable taxonomy that would allow outsiders to find the materials they needed without having to worry about differences in descriptions.\n\nKnowde has broken down the chemicals industry into ten different verticals including: food, pharmaceuticals, personal care, houseware goods, industrial chemicals. The company currently operates in three different verticals and plans to extend into all ten within the year.\n\nAmin-Jahaveri knows that he’s not going to get a meaningful chunk of business from the huge chemical manufacturers like BASF or Dow Chemical that pump out thousands of tons of commodity chemicals, those deals only represent $2 trillion of the total addressable market.\n\nThat means another $3 trillion in sales are up for grabs for the company Amin-Jahaveri founded with his partner Woyzeck Krupa.\n\nWhile the opportunity is huge, the company — like every other new business launching in 2020 — is still trying to do business in the middle of the worst economic collapse in American history. However, Amin-Jahaveri thinks the new economic reality could actually work in Knowde’s favor.\n\n“It’s going to be one more trigger event for these chemical companies that they have to go online,” he said. The personal relationships that drove much of the sales for the chemicals business before have dried up. No more conferences and events means no more opportunities to glad-hand, backslap, and chat over drinks at the hotel bar. So these companies need to find a new way to sell.\n\nMaguire sees another benefit to the movement of chemical catalogs into an online marketplace, and that’s internal transparency within chemical companies.\n\n“Even the biggest companies in the world do not have an internal search feature even for their own chemicals,” said Maguire. “I talked to two of the biggest companies in the world. In the case of one chemist who is a friend of mine. If you are trying to formulate some new concoction how do you find what chemicals you have in the company? If it’s in my division it’s pretty easy.. If I need chemicals from another division… there’s no way to search it right now.”"}

[…] Sweat equity is the best equity.”\n\nWe also got his take on today’s economy, the nation’s direction and his notes on what startups should do to survive in the new world. Happily, as we had an hour to chat, we managed to cover a lot of ground. The full conversation (YouTube) is after the jump, and we’ve excerpted a number of quotes for your perusal.\n\nBut up top we wanted to share Cuban’s notes regarding which companies should accept Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds from the Small Business Administration. The matter became a hot-button issue in and around Silicon Valley, where initial debate centered around which startups could access the money. After it became clear the first installment of PPP funds wasn’t going to last, whether startups should access to the capital at all became a question. Some venture-backed companies even decided to return their PPP check.\n\nAccording to Cuban, when PPP was first put together, the market’s “perspective was that there’d be plenty of money for everybody. You know, people didn’t really want to do the math.” Cuban said that if there was $350 billion in the pot and one million small businesses, the fund would have worked out to $350,000 apiece. “Well guess what,” he said, “there are 30 million companies, [and] like 20 of them are independent contractors.”\n\nOnce you did the calculations again with that many companies eligible for PPP funds, you could tell that the money wasn’t going to last. So Cuban told firms that he’s invested in where he has sway to “either not apply or just pay it back immediately.” Why? “For the betterment of the country and the economy,” he said, adding that “if you do have access to capital” or “your business isn’t dramatically impacted [then] let’s leave [the PPP money] for the people who need it the most.”\n\nAs noted, the full video is below (you can join Extra Crunch here!), along with Cuban’s notes on startup advice during the pandemic, American 2.0 (and Marc Andreessen’s essay), AI, pre-seed companies, his future in politics and how to pitch him.\n\nMark Cuban on the record\n\nHow he’s advising portfolio companies during the pandemic:\n\nSo first and foremost, communicate. Second is be honest. Third is be transparent. And fourth is be authentic. Because everybody is nervous. Everybody is terrified at a certain level. So you just have to recognize that. People are going to need that honesty from you and people are going to want communications from you. That’s been the primary thing around what these companies should do.\n\nRegarding cutting costs: Every business is different. On the smallest ones, they’re already grinding, and it’s typically dependent on the founder. I’ve really tried to encourage people to keep all their employees on if at all possible. That there’s gonna be a lot of change and that’s going to create a lot of opportunity. So, if you can hold on to your employees and push forward in any way, shape, or form, you may have an opportunity."}

A draft bill, first proposed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) in January, intends to provide exactly that. However, technology experts warn the bill not only fails to meet the challenge, it creates new problems of its own. My job is to enable journalists to do their work securely — to communicate with others, research sensitive stories and publish hard-hitting news. This bill introduces significant harm to journalists’ ability to protect their sources.\n\nUnder the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (or EARN IT) Act, a government commission would define best practices for how technology companies should combat this type of material. On the surface, EARN IT proposes an impactful approach. A New York Times investigation in September found that “many tech companies failed to adequately police sexual abuse imagery on their platforms.” The investigation highlighted features, offered by these companies, that provide “digital hiding places for perpetrators.”\n\nIn reality, the criticized features are exactly the same ones that protect our privacy online. They help us read The Washington Post in private and ensure we only see authentic content created by the journalists. They allow us to communicate with each other. They empower us to express ourselves. And they enable us to connect with journalists so the truth can make the page. This raises the question of whether the bill will primarily protect children or primarily undermine free speech online.\n\nIt should be pointed out that EARN IT does not try to ban the use of these features. In fact, the bill does not specifically mention them at all. But if we look at how companies would apply the “best practices,” it becomes clear that the government is intending to make these features difficult to provide, that the government is looking to discourage companies from offering — and increasing the use of — these features. By accepting EARN IT, we will give up our ability — and our children’s future abilities — to enjoy online, social, connected and private lives.\n\nOur digital life is protected by the same features that allow some bad people to do bad things online.\n\nFour of the “best practices” relate to requiring companies to have the ability to “identify” child sexual abuse material. Unfortunately, it’s not possible to identify this material without also having the ability to identify any and all other types of material — like a journalist communicating with a source, an activist sharing a controversial opinion or a doctor trying to raise the alarm about the coronavirus. Nothing prevents the government from later expanding the bill to cover other illegal acts, such as violence or drugs. And what happens when foreign governments want to have a say in what is “legal” and what is not?\n\nOur digital life is protected by the same features that allow some bad people to do bad things online. They protect us as we visit The Washington Post website, use the Signal app to contact one of its journalists or use the Tor Browser to submit information to their anonymous tip line. These features all enable privacy, a core component of the journalistic process. They enable journalists to pursue and tell the truth, without fear or favor. And not just in the U.S., but globally. We should empower and enable this work, not sabotage it by removing crucial capabilities, even in the name of child protection.\n\nThe same New York Times investigation found that law enforcement agencies devoted to fighting online child exploitation “were left understaffed and underfunded, even as they were asked to handle far larger caseloads.” The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), established by Congress in 1984 to reduce child sexual exploitation and prevent child victimization, “was ill equipped for the expanding demands.” It’s worth asking, then, why EARN IT does not instead empower these agencies with additional resources to solve crimes.\n\nWe must consider the possibility that this bill fails to achieve its stated goal. That it will not protect children online, and will introduce harm to their digital presence and ability to speak freely. Everyone deserves good security, and it’s on us to find ways to prevent harm without compromising on our digital rights. To force companies to weaken our protection to give law enforcement greater insight would be the equivalent of forcing people to live without locks and curtains in their homes. Are we willing to go that far?\n\nThat’s not to say we have to accept no solution. But it can’t be this one."}

Maybe it wasn’t fast enough for AWS, as Andy Jassy made clear in his 2019 Re:invent keynote, but it was happening all the same and the steady revenue increases across the cloud infrastructure market bore that out.\n\nAs we look at the most recent quarter’s earnings reports for the main players in the market, it seems the pandemic and economic fall out has done little to slow that down. In fact, it may be contributing to its growth.\n\nAccording to numbers supplied by Synergy Research, the cloud infrastructure market totaled $29 billion in revenue for Q12020.\n\nSynergy’s John Dinsdale, who has been watching this market for a long time, says that the pandemic could be contributing to some of that growth, at least modestly. In spite of the numbers, he doesn’t necessarily see these companies getting out of this unscathed either, but as companies shift operations from offices, it could be part of the reason for the increased demand we saw in the first quarter.\n\n“For sure, the pandemic is causing some issues for cloud providers, but in uncertain times, the public cloud is providing flexibility and a safe haven for enterprises that are struggling to maintain normal operations. Cloud provider revenues continue to grow at truly impressive rates, with AWS and Azure in aggregate now having an annual revenue run rate of well over $60 billion,” Dinsdale said in a statement.\n\nAWS led the way with a third of the market or more than $10 billion in quarterly revenue as it continues to hold a substantial lead in market share. Microsoft was in second, growing at a brisker 59% for 18% of the market. While Microsoft doesn’t break out its numbers, using Synergy’s numbers, that would work out to around $5.2 billion for Azure revenue. Meanwhile Google came in third with $2.78 billion.\n\nIf you’re keeping track of market share at home, it comes out to 32% for AWS, 18% for Microsoft and 8% for Google. This split has remained fairly steady, although Microsoft has managed to gain a few percentage points over the last several quarters as its overall growth rate outpaces Amazon."}

Thighs should be parallel to the floor and feet should sit flat. If they dangle even a little, put a box or some books on the floor to support them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead on about some common work-from-home maladies and the ergonomic adjustments and physical exercises that can prevent and treat them.\n\nLower back discomfort\n\nWhen you’re sitting too long and perhaps not exercising regularly, “your hamstrings get tight and pull, putting abnormal strain on your lumbar spine,” says Jonas Rudzki, a D.C.-based orthopedic surgeon. Combined with weakened core muscles, that can cause low back discomfort and pain around the hips, exacerbating conditions such as sciatica. He recommends stretching the hamstrings: While seated, rest your heel on the floor with your knee straight and gently lean forward until you feel a stretch behind your knee and thigh.\n\nAD\n\nTo make sure your lower back is supported while you work, sit back in the chair so it’s cradling your spine all the way up to your shoulder blades. If your chair lacks lumbar support, roll up a towel and nestle it between the small of your back and the chair. For remote workers who suffer from sciatica, Cinkay recommends sitting a bit lower so the knees are slightly higher than the hip. “It puts the hamstring muscles in a more slackened position, and that’s what the sciatic nerve runs through,” he says.\n\nAD\n\nUpper back and shoulder tightness\n\nEven if you begin the day sitting up and straight, it only takes 10 to 15 minutes before your body settles into poor posture that can lead to injury. “When we’re working long hours in a suboptimal space, muscle tension and fatigue builds up in the trapezius back muscles, the muscles around the neck and in the shoulder area,” says Rudzki. To relieve tension, use an elastic fitness band to do a simple exercise that mimics rowing: Wrap the band around a doorknob or other stationary object. Stand holding the ends of the band with your elbows bent and at your side. Keeping your arms close to your body, slowly pull the band straight back, squeezing the shoulder blades together, and repeat.\n\nAD\n\nHead and neck aches\n\nRemote working also accounts for a recent surge in head and neck pain. “Looking down at a screen puts a lot of stress on your spine, leading to cervicogenic headaches,” says Koshy. The human head typically weighs about 10 pounds, but when tilted downward, say 45 degrees, the weight on the cervical spine increases exponentially, putting excess strain on the neck.\n\nAD\n\nAnd it’s not just adults who are feeling the pain. “I’m seeing 8-year-olds who are reporting headaches, which is unusual but not surprising given that kids are on screens all the time now,” says Karen Erickson, a New York-based chiropractor and the spokesperson for the American Chiropractic Association.\n\nAD\n\nTo promote good posture and prevent neck and upper back injuries, she suggests positioning screens at eye level. Placing a stack of books under a monitor is an easy hack. Ideally, the center of the screen should be 15 degrees below your line of sight. If you’re using a laptop, consider purchasing a separate keyboard, which makes it easier to elevate the screen. Periodically stretching your neck muscles helps, too. Take turns trying to touch your ear to your shoulder on each side and extend your neck upward by looking at the ceiling.\n\nWrist pain\n\nAvoiding wrist pain is another reason laptop users might find a separate keyboard worth the investment. “When people work on laptops, it creates a sort of ulnar deviation of the wrist. People twist their palms to the outside and it puts a stress on the median nerve,” says Koshy. When the median nerve is squeezed or compressed, it can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo keep wrists limber, he recommends a few simple hand stretches, such as fist-to-fan: Make a fist and extend your fingers out wide like a fan and repeat. Or you can squeeze a rolled-up sock, hold for five seconds, then release. Repeat 10 times, a few times a day.\n\nEyestrain\n\nIf you think your posture is the only casualty of staring down at a screen, think again. “We don’t realize how much our eyes suffer based on where we put our computer,” says Koshy. “Say you have a window behind your monitor and the view outside is brighter or has a different illumination level. Your eye is constantly adjusting like a camera to accommodate the two different intensities of light.” Similarly, if the light from a window is behind you, it might be reflected in your screen, which can also cause eyestrain. He suggests setting up your desk so the window is perpendicular to it. And no matter where your computer is situated, it’s important to take frequent visual breaks. Set a timer to employ the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at an object 20 feet in the distance for 20 seconds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInternal organ compression\n\nSlouching over a computer for hours at a time, which puts pressure on your internal organs, can compromise both your lung function and digestion. “When you slump forward, you compress the contents of your stomach and push it back up into your esophagus. For someone who already has reflux, sitting in that posture can make it much worse,” says Erickson. To stretch the diaphragm and the muscles of the digestive cavity, she recommends simple side bends and reaching your arms to the sky, one at a time, then both together, from a sitting or standing position.\n\nFalls\n\nSince the shelter-in-place order began, Koshy has also noticed an uptick in acute computer-related injuries that have nothing to do with working. “Lately, we’re seeing more mishaps where kids or older adults trip over computer cords or equipment that’s not normally there, like at the kitchen table,” he says. In 2009, a study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine reported a sevenfold increase in injuries such as tripping and falling over cords, especially among children under 5 due to an increase in home computer equipment from 1994 through 2006. Consider taping down cords — if you have hardwood floors, make sure you use a tape that won’t harm the finish — or purchasing a floor cord cover.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlood clots\n\nAnother potential danger of our new home-based existence: “Sometimes you are so focused on what’s in front of you, you forget that you just went three hours without moving,” says Koshy. That kind of sedentary behavior could lead to a deep vein thrombosis, a clot that originates in the leg vein and can travel to the lungs with fatal consequences for those at risk, such as women who are pregnant or taking birth control, the elderly and smokers. “Blood tends to pool at your feet when you sit a lot, and for those prone to clots it’s a real concern,” he says. Whether you’re engrossed in work or binging on the latest must-watch show, set a timer to go off every hour as a reminder to get up and move.\n\nTo decrease time spent sitting while working, Cinkay likes a sit-to-stand desk model, but if a standing desk is not an option, you can move your laptop or desktop to a counter. In fact, it’s ideal to alternate your work area throughout the day if you can. For instance, start the day at the dining room table, move to a standing position with a laptop at the kitchen counter, and so on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFoot soreness\n\nAnd while it may be tempting to pad around the house barefoot to rebel against years of wearing wingtips or pumps, you might want to reconsider — especially if you have hardwood floors. “It’s great to get out of high heels because it takes a lot of negative stress off your feet, but if you have any discomfort in your feet or if you are still transitioning to working from home, wear a comfortable running shoe that has more support and a bit of a heel lift,” says Rudzki. To minimize the chance of developing heel pain and plantar fasciitis, he suggests doing a basic runner’s stretch where you lunge toward a wall with one foot forward while stretching the ankle of your back leg.\n\nThe sooner you incorporate some of these changes and exercises, the better off you’ll be in the long run — and it may be a long run.

Mr Kim had never missed this event.\n\nClaims about Mr Kim's ill-health then surfaced in a report for a website run by North Korean defectors.\n\nAn anonymous source told the Daily NK that they understood he had been struggling with cardiovascular problems since last August \"but it worsened after repeated visits to Mount Paektu\".\n\nThis led to a chain of reporting by international media on a single-sourced story.\n\nNews agencies then began to run with that claim, and it was all they had until some reports emerged that intelligence agencies in South Korea and the US were monitoring the claim.\n\nBut then came a more sensational headline in US media that the North Korean leader was in a critical condition after heart surgery.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who is North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un?\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to stoke the rumours on 29 April, by saying US officials \"hadn't seen\" Mr Kim recently.\n\nHowever, a statement from the South Korean government, and sources at Chinese intelligence - speaking to the Reuters news agency - said this was not true.\n\nHas Kim Jong-un disappeared before?\n\nYes. Mr Kim went missing for 40 days in September 2014, after attending a concert. He reappeared in mid-October, using a cane.\n\nState media never explained where he had been. But South Korea's intelligence agency said he probably had an operation on his left ankle stemming from problems with a cyst.\n\nCaution is often tossed aside when reporting on North Korea. Thinly sourced, wildly speculative rumours can feed an industry aware that sensationalist headlines about Kim Jong-un are great clickbait.\n\nReporting on the secretive state is difficult. Facts and sources are very difficult to obtain, especially since the country is even more closed off to the world due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The South Korean government was clear that it noted no unusual activity in the North. Seoul often has the best intelligence from Pyongyang. But even they have been wrong in the past.\n\nLet's be clear. Kim Jong-un could have been ill, or he could have had some sort of surgical procedure in the last two weeks. Or he could have been lounging on a yacht near his villa in Wonsan laughing at the world's wild speculation. His 20 day absence is not without precedent.\n\nThere are still valid questions to be asked about a potential successor and what plans are in place should something happen to him.\n\nBut there is one thing that has been lost in all of this. North Korea is more than one man. It is a country of 25 million people who are often overlooked. Today, Mr Kim's reappearance was at a fertiliser plant. The headlines will of course focus on his return, and on where he has been rather than on whether this factory will help the country tackle chronic food shortages.\n\nI assure you, that for the people of North Korea right now, that is just as important as the unexplained absence of their leader."}

I walked out of the gym and threw my cigs into a big blue bin next to the door.”\n\nShe has never smoked a cigarette since.\n\n“I drove home and had a chicken salad for dinner, which was unheard of for me,” she adds.\n\n“The next day I woke up at five o’clock in the morning and went running. I kept doing it every day and before I knew it I was winning titles.”\n\n‘I knew my face would fit the pro game’\n\nShannon Courtenay fights at super-bantamweight\n\nDespite her inexperience, Courtenay’s raw power and aggressive, come-forward fighting style was soon being noticed by fans and promoters alike.\n\nShe was, fittingly, given the nickname ‘Baby-faced Assassin’ by a boxing journalist after an amateur bout.\n\nThree years after her first fight, she signed a professional contract with Matchroom Boxing.\n\n“I knew my face would fit the pro game,” she says.\n\n“My style is fan-friendly. I don’t mind taking a dig to land two more. You don’t really see women fight like that. Although that isn’t always the best way to go about it.”\n\nWomen’s boxing has been on a high in recent years through the success of Ireland’s Olympic gold medallist and world champion Katie Taylor, the most decorated female fighter active today, and Britain's now-retired Nicola Adams, the first female to win a boxing gold medal at an Olympic Games.\n\nCourtenay, while appreciating that other fighters have paved the way, believes that being relatively new to the sport will work in her favour.\n\n“My body is still fresh, I don't have that much wear and tear like others may have. And because I have only been in the sport for four or five years, I am loving every second of it. Whereas other women fighters may be getting sick of it,\" she says.\n\n'Social media can be a nasty place'\n\nIt is not just Courtenay’s boxing ability which is proving popular.\n\nFrom documenting her fitness regime during the coronavirus lockdown, to a hilarious video edit of retired former world champion Tony Bellew's parenting struggles, external-link her activeness on social media and willingness to interact with fans has helped build a loyal following.\n\n“I’m just myself. I don’t put on an act. I don’t pretend to be a character which I then have to play for the rest of my life,” she says.\n\n“And it’s worked well because people can relate to me.”\n\nBeing relatable with the public stems from her upbringing; her mum was a pub landlady and Courtenay has grown up in and around that environment since the age of four.\n\n“I am used to the banter and I can dish it out as well,” she adds.\n\n“I’m easy to talk to because I’ve grown up around a vast variety of people.”\n\nBut even with her light-hearted nature, Courtenay has experienced the “vulgar side” of social media since turning professional.\n\n“When I first turned pro, everything suddenly changed. I went from being a nobody to people taking pictures in supermarkets and suddenly social media blew up,” she says.\n\n“It got a bit difficult for me at first. Some people on social media can be nasty.”\n\nCourtenay does hope to use her online presence to inspire young girls, starting first with her younger sister, although says she was not too comfortable with the ‘role model’ tag at first.\n\n“I’d laugh at the thought of it,” she says.\n\n“But now I get messages daily from people saying that because of me, their daughter took up boxing or they’ve gone for a run.\n\n“I’ve got a 13-year-old sister and I know there aren’t that many role models around.

This is a long and detailed process and is very much in the early stages of planning.\"\n\nIf cricket resumes in July, it would seem likely that England's first engagement would be against West Indies.\n\nThe earliest date a series could start is thought to be 8 July. For that to be the case, West Indies would have to travel by mid-June.\n\nIn the previous schedule, the West Indies series was due to be followed by limited-overs matches against Australia, Tests and Twenty20s against Pakistan, then a one-day series with Ireland.\n\nAmong the options for rescheduling the summer could be to bring the Ireland series forward, in between the matches against West Indies and Pakistan, and push the Australia games to later in the summer.\n\nAny plans England make could be complicated by a rescheduled Indian Premier League (IPL), although that would not affect touring Pakistanis because their players do not feature in that competition.\n\nMeanwhile, Cricket Sri Lanka (SLC) chief executive Ashley de Silva said England's postponed two-Test tour from March has been rescheduled for January 2021.\n\nIn response, the ECB said: \"Planning for England men's winter programme continues.\n\n\"The ECB and SLC are in discussions at finding a solution.

And we definitely had the conversation, 'What if we don't go back?'\"\n\nThe streets of the city she loves -- and many major cities across the US -- are hauntingly empty as the pandemic leaves most of the country on lockdown.\n\nIt's a chilling sign of the times, and one that brings to mind a big question: After the pandemic passes, will some people choose to leave big-city life behind?\n\nThat trend was already starting to emerge in some parts of the country, even before coronavirus hit.\n\nNow the pandemic is changing the way we talk about life in big cities.

More than 12,000 coronavirus deaths have been confirmed in the city so far.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo hasn't minced words when he describes the reasons he sees for the rapid spread of the virus.\n\nA slide from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's April 13 press conference shows a key factor he blamed for the rapid spread of coronavirus in New York.\n\n\"Why New York? Why are we seeing this level of infection? Well, why cities across the country?\" Cuomo said at a news briefing last month\n\n\"It's very simple,\" the governor said. \"It's about density. It's about the number of people in a small geographic location allowing that virus to spread. ... Dense environments are its feeding grounds.\"\n\nHe sees sprawl as a saving grace\n\nOn the other side of the country, Joel Kotkin says the situation that's unfolding is notably different\n\nIn a recent opinion piece published in the Los Angeles Times , Kotkin credited that city's sprawling development with slowing the spread of coronavirus. The headline: \"Angelenos like their single-family sprawl. The coronavirus proves them right.\"\n\nThe executive director of the Houston-based Urban Reform Institute, Kotkin argues that cities were already in trouble. And in the age of social distancing, he says, dense cities particularly have a lot going against them.\n\n\"How do you open up an office with expensive real estate if people have to be six feet apart? How are you going to have a city dependent on subways if you're going to have any social distancing at all?\" he tells CNN. \"People will continue to move more into the periphery and into smaller cities, where basically you can get around without getting on (public) transit.\"\n\nJoel Kotkin argues the more sprawling development of Los Angeles put the city in a better position to face the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nEpidemics have made people move before\n\nEpidemics historically have played a big role in shaping where and how people live in New York and other cities, said David Rosner, co-director of the Center for the History and Ethics of Public Health at Columbia University.\n\nAfter a cholera epidemic hit the city in the 19th century, for example, people began to move from lower Manhattan to other neighborhoods -- if they could afford to.\n\n\"You start seeing the suburban communities kind of segregate according to class and movement of people,\" he says. \"You start seeing the marketing of land based upon the experience with disease. ... You start seeing land actually being advertised as healthful or unhealthful.\"\n\nImmigrants being inspected at Ellis Island, New York, in the early 1900s for signs of disease as they arrive in the United States.\n\nIt's a pattern that Rosner sees emerging again.\n\n\"Travel and movement away from disease centers is also a reflection of that kind of social prejudice. Somehow we still believe that being in the country must be safer,\" he says. \"It's more a reflection of our attitudes towards the urban environment and fear of our neighbors. That's a sad reality of this epidemic.\"\n\nThis economist says 'density isn't destiny'\n\nAs the director of The City Observatory, a think tank focused on data-driven analysis, he's been crunching the numbers for weeks as the pandemic spread.\n\nAnd Cortright says they reveal an important distinction: \"Density,\" he argues, \"isn't destiny.\" Translation: There are plenty of densely populated cities around the world that haven't seen coronavirus cases climb as much as New York's has. Cortright points to Tokyo, Taipei, and Seoul, and to Vancouver , one of the densest large cities in North America.\n\nCrowds of shoppers fill the streets of Midtown Manhattan on November 29, 2019, in New York City.\n\nAlso, he says, there are suburban and rural areas that have been particularly hard hit.\n\n\"Some people think, 'Can I flee to avoid this problem? Then when you look around you, it's a pandemic. There's no place you can go where you are free from it,\" he says.\n\n\"I think that's one of the lessons here: With information and smart policy, there's no reason why cities are inherently going to be hit harder.\"\n\n'Gen Z' will play a key role in what happens next\n\nBut even before coronavirus hit, there were already signs more people in the US were moving to the suburbs.\n\nChicago and Los Angeles also saw their populations dip in recent years as the economy picked up in the suburbs and elsewhere. Other big cities have seen growth virtually stagnate.\n\n\"It's not just a New York thing,\" says William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \"It's a kind of softening of growth among cities all over the country.\"\n\nBut even so, Frey says it's too soon to push the panic button on cities.\n\nA lone commuter waits for an \"L\" train during rush hour in Chicago on March 20.\n\n\"People have always come back to cities during some of the biggest disasters we've had in our history. ... When we look ahead in the next year or two, I'm not so concerned that we're going to see decline in city populations long-term,\" he says.\n\nIf the recent past is any indication, Frey says in fact, more people may end up moving into cities post-pandemic.\n\nImmediately after the Great Recession, millennials flocked into cities and spurred a period of growth and revitalization. And in the aftermath of this unfolding economic crisis, Frey says Generation Z could take a similar tack.\n\nMembers of that generation, born from 1997 to 2012 , have strong urban roots and are likely to be drawn to cities, Frey says.\n\n\"If they follow in the footsteps of millennials during a similarly dim period, they could help invigorate city growth -- especially if opportunities dry up elsewhere,\" Frey wrote in a recent analysis on the Brookings website\n\nHow working remotely could reshape the market\n\nAlison Bernstein says she's already seeing a shift in the other direction.\n\nShe's fielding three times the calls she was at this time last year from families in search of greener pastures — fewer crowds, more space and a better quality of life.\n\nBernstein's company, Suburban Jungle, helps city-dwellers relocate to the suburbs. And the pandemic, she says, has pushed even more people to consider making the move.\n\n\"People are scared, and it's not something that is going to be swept under the rug,\" she says. \"And I think people are going to really re-evaluate the quality of life that they're looking for. So I think we're going to see a big migration into lifestyle-rich cities like Nashville, Austin, South Florida.\"\n\nChildren play on a residential street in Matawan, New Jersey on April 1, 2020.\n\nWhat's more, she says, another pre-pandemic trend is intensifying: the rise in working remotely.\n\nThat could play an even bigger role in reshaping the housing market going forward, says Skylar Olsen, senior principal economist at Zillow.\n\nAlready, millennials were increasingly turning to suburbs , smaller cities and places on the periphery because they'd largely been priced out of buying in big cities.\n\n\"If we can provide another option like remote work, then people can make new, different decisions,\" she says. \"Your job and your home used to be tied together in a way that we're all learning they might not have to be.\"\n\nMoms' groups are raising questions about moving\n\nLifelong New Yorker Chloé Jo Davis never imagined leaving her beloved city -- until now.\n\nDavis and her husband were already used to working from home, but weeks spent cramped inside their rented two-bedroom apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side -- homeschooling their three young sons and caring for four rescue pets -- have changed her calculation.\n\n\"I feel like I've been through a monsoon every day,\" she says.\n\n\"If here we are in New York City, and the reasons we're here, the reasons we're willing to sacrifice all the basic sort of life benefits that a lot of people have...is for the art, the culture, the diversity, the neighborhood camaraderie,\" she says. \"And now, without that, what do we have? We're stacked in boxes.\"\n\nAfter more than 48 days holed up inside a crowded New York apartment with her husband, three kids and four rescue animals, Chloé Jo Davis says they're now looking for a house in the suburbs -- something she never expected she'd do.\n\nDavis says her family is now looking to leave the density of New York City for the space of the suburbs. Already, she says, prices for rentals outside the city are soaring as demand grows. But she knows they are lucky to have the means to even consider such a move.\n\nA number of moms' groups she's part of on Facebook lead her to believe that many New York mothers are in a similar position. The same three questions, she says, keep popping up:\n\nWho knows a good mover that does social distancing moves?\n\nWhich 'burb do you like better?\n\nDoes anybody want to take over the lease for my two-bedroom?\n\nSo many friends and neighbors have left the city, at least temporarily.\n\n\"It seems to be just a mass exodus,\" she says.\n\nA empty train sits at a PATH station in Hoboken, New Jersey, on March 16, 2020.\n\nBut speaking to CNN on the phone from her in-laws' house in New Mexico, Stevens-Walter says she also knows plenty of people who can't leave the city, and many who are determined to keep living there -- herself included.\n\n\"I'm deeply homesick for New York. We live there for a reason, for many reasons,\" she says.\n\nAs artists and musicians, she and her husband feel inspired there. And she says the city makes her multi-racial, multi-ethnic family feel welcome.\n\n\"New York provides a safety for us that we really can't get anywhere else,\" she says.\n\nFor these reasons and so many more, New York will always be home. But she's been bracing herself for a new reality.\n\nShe knows the city she returns to will be very different from the city she left."}

Experts say the virus won't be a thing of the past any time soon.\n\nA second round of Covid-19 cases is \"inevitable\" come fall, the nation's top infectious disease doctor said, as people increasingly try to resume regular life and more states ease or lift their stay-at-home orders.\n\n\"I'm almost certain it will come back, because the virus is so transmissible and it's globally spread,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci during an Economic Club of Washington webinar earlier this week.\n\nAmericans could be in for \"a bad fall and a bad winter\" if the country is unprepared, said Fauci, who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nHere's what we know about the possibility of a second wave of the virus and the reasoning behind it.\n\nWhy in the fall?\n\nThere are many aspects of the virus that remain unknown for scientists but older viruses are offering some clues.\n\nDr. Greg Poland, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the Mayo Clinic, said that SARS-CoV-2, the technical name for the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19, is likely to follow that pattern.\n\nIf that happens, a second wave of the virus would return just in time for the start of flu season. The flu has been a constant threat for Americans and devastating in recent years. The CDC estimates there were at least 39 million cases of the flu in the US and at least 24,000 deaths during the 2019-2020 season.\n\nPoland, the director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group , says the combination of a second wave of Covid-19 with flu season could create \"a lot of confusion\" because of their overlap in symptoms and put a heavy strain on the health care system.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first pandemic to come back in force. In 2009, the US experienced a wave of cases of the H1N1 influenza virus , known as swine flu, in the spring. Months later, a second wave was reported in the fall and winter, the CDC says.\n\n\"Often, not always ... often the second wave of a pandemic is worse,\" Poland said, adding that the coronavirus pandemic spread in the US well into the flu season.\n\nAnother example is the 1918 influenza pandemic , which killed 50 million people globally and about 675,000 Americans. At the time, there was an initial mild spring wave in the US but a lethal second wave hit the country in September.\n\nIt appear that the novel coronavirus is likely to keep spreading for at least another 18 months. There are several possible scenarios for the course of the pandemic but the worst of them is a second wave of infections just like the 1918 influenza pandemic, according to a report by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\"This thing's not going to stop until it infects 60 to 70 percent of people,\" said Mike Osterholm, the CIDRAP director, in an interview with CNN.\n\n\"The idea that this is going to be done soon defies microbiology.\"\n\nOsterholm coauthored a CIDRAP report released Thursday that recommended the US prepare for a worst-case scenario that includes a second big wave of coronavirus infections in the fall and winter.\n\nWhat can be done about a second wave of infection?\n\nHealth experts say the coming months would be a good time to prepare for a potential second outbreak of the virus.\n\nHospitals and clinics should replenish their stocks of personal protective equipment and testing supplies. People should try to get healthier if possible, continue using face masks for the time being and keep gatherings to no more than 10 people, several experts told CNN.\n\nAs cities reopen, local officials should make plans to quickly reissue stay-at-home orders or other strict social distancing measures in the future if needed, Poland said\n\nHealth officials across the country must continue focusing on expanding coronavirus testing, contact tracing and treatment, said Dr. Helen Boucher, chief of the geographic medicine and infectious diseases division at Tufts University Medical Center.\n\n\"We hope we'll have more tools in our toolbox, maybe we'll have some treatments for Covid-19 by then, maybe we'll have better diagnostics,\" Boucher said.\n\nThe Trump administration has estimated a vaccine is 12 to 18 months away, though some leaders in the field say that timeline could be too fast.\n\nImproving the way health workers handle the coronavirus pandemic will be key, Boucher says, so the country is \"as prepared as we can be\" when it's time to face an outbreak of both the coronavirus and the flu.\n\nWhile most experts believe that people who have recovered from the virus will have some sort of immunity, Poland says it's unclear how strong that immunity might be, how long it might last and the accuracy of antibody tests is inconsistent.\n\n\"We are placing a lot of hope on that but we don't have answers yet,\" Poland said. \"This (virus) is only 16 weeks old so there's a lot we don't know yet.\"\n\nThe experimental anti-viral drug remdesivir was approved on Friday by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat hospitalized Covid-19 patients in severe condition.\n\nis The drug, which is the first authorized treatment for Covid-19,is far from a cure , according to a government-funded study, but patients who took it recovered faster than patients who did not.\n\n\"We have work to do. We are looking for other therapies. This trial is going to continue,\" Dr. Andre Kalil, the principal investigation behind the clinical trial, told CNN's Elizabeth Cohen earlier this week.\n\nHas the virus made a comeback elsewhere?\n\nYes.\n\nIn recent weeks, Singapore has seen a dramatic spike in coronavirus infections, with thousands of new cases linked to clusters in foreign worker dormitories\n\nSingapore had initially been praised for its response and apparent ability to suppress infections in the first three months of the coronavirus pandemic. Then the number of cases exploded in April.\n\nSince March 17, Singapore's total cases grew from 266 to more than 17,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University\n\nTo control the spread, the government has attempted to isolate the dormitories, test workers and move symptomatic patients into quarantine facilities. It's a daunting task because workers live in cramped conditions that make social distancing near impossible. The government also instituted what it is calling a \"circuit breaker,\" a package of restrictions and new rules, combined with harsh punishments."}

One such state, Georgia, still requires the elderly to stay home until June 12.\n\nOther states and counties will ease restrictions starting Monday. Gyms and fitness centers will reopen in Arkansas on May 4, while hair salons will follow May 6. In Northern California's Yuba and Sutter counties, restaurants, tattoo parlors and shopping malls will be allowed to open Monday, which will also be the first workday for many offices in Colorado, with operations limited to 50% capacity.\n\nIn Montana, bars and breweries will also be allowed to provide some in-establishment services starting Monday.

Until we get there, it is inappropriate and dangerous to reopen local businesses,\" Redlener wrote in a letter accompanying the report.\n\nBut the country continues to lag behind in testing and months since the beginning of the outbreak is still unable to perform the millions of tests that economists and public heath experts said last month will be required before measures can be safely lifted.\n\nShoppers try out newly opened retail stores in Georgia\n\nIn Georgia, retail stores were allowed to reopen Friday, with distancing and sanitation caveats. In the Atlanta suburb of Alpharetta, shoppers ventured out to the Avalon outdoor mall, where about 20 of roughly 100 stores reopened.\n\nWhile most of the open shops offered only curbside pickup or appointment shopping, Altar'd State, a women's clothing store, allowed walk-in guests, though only 10 people inside at a time, including employees. Associates wore gloves and regularly sanitized fitting rooms.\n\nEvery article of clothing that a customer tried on but didn't purchase was placed into a high-temperature steaming machine before being returned to racks.\n\nAt Altar'd State, a women's clothing store in suburban Atlanta, an associate steams clothing that customers had tried on Friday, May 2, 2020\n\nOutside, retired nurse Kate Martin waited her turn to enter the store. She said she'd been eager to get out of her house for some fresh air -- but she still had reservations about coming.\n\n\"I still think it might be a little too soon to come back out and be this close together. So, we'll see,\" she said. \"Let's hope the outcome is good.\"\n\nKate Martin waited to enter the Altar'd State clotthing store on Friday.\n\nMall workers distributed masks to guests, though not every guest chose to wear them.\n\nMartin wore a mask. She hoped others would wear them, too.\n\n\"You might not get as sick, but (older people) will, and they will get it from you. Do it for your grandmother,\" she said.\n\nA week earlier, Georgia allowed bowling alleys, gyms and personal-service stores like nail salons and barber shops to reopen, with similar distancing and sanitation requirements. Restaurants were permitted to open Monday.\n\nCDC: Summer will be critical in fight against virus\n\nHow the country fares in the next few months will be \"critical\" in the fight against coronavirus and how it will evolve in the fall, Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.\n\n\"The more we intensify the testing and expand the public health capacity and assure that our hospital capacity and material to support the hospitals is adequate or has excess, the better we're going to be in the fall,\" Schuchat said in an interview with JAMA Network.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease doctor, this week said he believes a second round of the virus is \"inevitable\" and how deadly that round is will be determined by how prepared the US is.\n\n\"If by that time we have put into place all of the countermeasures that you need to address this, we should do reasonably well,\" he said. \"If we don't do that successfully, we could be in for a bad fall and a bad winter.\"\n\nFauci has also warned that lifting measures prematurely could lead to a rebound of the virus that could put the US in the \"same boat that we were a few weeks ago.\"\n\nProtest over orders leads to more than two dozen arrests\n\nMany governors have faced resistance in the recent weeks from residents who want lockdown measures lifted and businesses reopened.\n\nIn California, more than 30 people were arrested Friday during a demonstration at the state capitol building to protest Gov. Gavin Newsom's stay-at-home order, CNN affiliate KCRA reported.\n\nMore than 1,000 people had gathered, some waving American flags and signs against the order.\n\n\"This disease doesn't know if you're a protester, a Democrat, a Republican,\" the governor said Friday. \"Protect yourself, protect your family, your kids, your parents, your grandparents, your neighbors.\"\n\n\"I appreciate expression, points of view,\" Newsom said, \"but we're interested in evidence, and the evidence shows some good things, but some yellow flags of caution.\"\n\nNewsom said the state is \"days, not weeks\" away from beginning to lift restrictions.\n\n\"I just want folks to know that we are getting very close to making really meaningful augmentations to that stay-at-home order,\" the governor said in his daily coronavirus briefing.\n\nThe governor issued the order after scolding beachgoers that packed some shores in the state during scorching temperatures last weekend.\n\nFDA approves remdesivir\n\nMeanwhile, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the experimental drug remdesivir as treatment for hospitalized patients with severe coronavirus, the agency said Friday.\n\nThis is the first authorized therapy for the virus in the country, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said.\n\n\"This is an important clinical advance that showed a statistically significant reduction in time to recovery for patients with Covid-19 and is the first authorized therapy for Covid-19.\" Hahn said.\n\nThe drug was approved just days after researchers said it might help patients recover more quickly from the infection.\n\nIn an emergency-use authorization Friday, the agency said the benefits of using the drug outweighed the risks.\n\nHere's what else happened this week:\n\n• A model often cited by the White House upped its predictions for the US death toll by August , partially because of measures lifted prematurely."}

Do not take me back there,'\" his son Raj Nathwani said.\n\nDeath was not an outcome Raj, 55, was willing to accept -- but he knew his father's chances of surviving coronavirus were not in his favor.\n\nRaj had been tracking the virus since January, watching countless news reports: about the toll it had taken on multigenerational households; about medics in Italy's overstretched health system being too swamped to make home visits; about elderly people in China with pre-existing conditions -- including the one his father has -- having a higher chance of dying.\n\n\"I'm not a betting man, but if I was... [I would] definitely put my money on him not making it,\" Suri's family doctor, general practitioner Dr. Bharat Thacker, told CNN.\n\nRaj Nathwani, his mother Kanchan, father Suryakant (Suri), and brother Manish (left to right). Suri survived Covid-19 despite his age and ill health.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 219,000 people worldwide, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University in the US.\n\nBut official death tolls are largely made up of patients who died in intensive care wards or other hospital departments. The number of people dying in the community -- many in their own homes or care homes -- are often under-reported\n\nAs he helped Suri up to bed after his arrival home from Watford General Hospital, on the outskirts of London, Raj worried whether the desperate series of events that had seen the virus spread across the globe would turn his father into another statistic.\n\nRaj, a director of insight at an advertising firm, remained outwardly positive: \"You're not going to die. We're going to look after you here,\" he told his father. What he did not know was just how successful he would be.\n\nThe descent\n\nBaby monitor footage shows Suri Nathwani using a CPAP machine in his home as he recovers from coronavirus.\n\nRaj, who had himself recovered from a heart attack last November, was prepared for the pandemic weeks before the UK lockdown began on March 23. He had been in self-isolation alongside his 80-year-old mother and his father, who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), since March 11, because the entire household was considered to be at high risk from coronavirus.\n\nBut his father's condition began to deteriorate on March 25. Suri's daily 10-minute walk outside the family home turned into a 45-minute stagger. His lung condition was flaring up. He looked fatigued, listless, and -- although he did not display the high temperature or persistent cough, which the NHS considered the main symptoms of the virus -- Raj suspected his father had Covid-19.\n\nUnbeknownst to the family, Suri's lungs were filling with liquid -- a fact that was spotted by paramedics called to the family's home the following day, when the octogenarian had trouble breathing.\n\nHe was taken to hospital, but doctors called Raj shortly afterward. He says they told him they were 95% sure Suri had the virus, but that they wanted to discharge him and send him home.\n\nRaj says a senior consultant told him that if Suri's condition worsened they would not ventilate him \"because he felt his lungs, with ... COPD, would not be able to handle it.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to Watford General Hospital for comment on Suri's case, but has not received a response. CNN has seen Suri's discharge sheet, which includes a \"do not resuscitate\" (DNR) order that was completed upon his admission.\n\nVentilation can be life-saving, but even in ordinary times, health practitioners warn that being admitted into intensive care gives no guarantee of recovery for older patients.\n\nSuri's son Raj, an analytics specialist, created a spreadsheet to track his father's vital signs.\n\nRaj said he was left with two choices: \"Do I keep him there and risk never seeing him again, or do I bring him home and spend all my energy making it comfortable for him?\" He chose the latter, even at the risk of spreading the infection through the entire household.\n\nBefore Suri returned to his Watford home -- in a local taxi, as there was no ambulance available to move him -- Raj spent the afternoon cleaning the house, isolating his mother on the ground floor, and turning his parents' first floor bedroom into a makeshift hospital ward.\n\nWith little medical knowledge, or advice from the hospital on how to administer palliative care, Raj resorted to doing what he did best: collecting and analyzing data. He created a Google spreadsheet to help track his father's temperature, blood pressure and oxygen saturation readings -- vitals that could be measured with a store-bought thermometer, blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter.\n\nTo limit the amount of time Raj spent in the room, an iPad was set up with a baby monitor app. This enabled the rest of his tight-knit family to help out, giving Raj's brother, Manish, who lives in the US, and his sons, who live nearby with their mother, the opportunity to check in on Suri, helping to ease his lonely isolation. It also meant they could take turns monitoring him when Raj needed to rest.\n\nThe strategist also turned to a family friend, a general practice doctor, for advice. The GP advised on Suri's hydration, and kept track of his vital signs on the Google spreadsheet.\n\nRaj says that perhaps the key factor when it came to treating his father was the fact that their home was already equipped with a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP machine, for Suri's sleep apnea.\n\n\"When Dad's breathing got worse, I was advised to use the machine,\" he said, explaining that when his father's condition was at its most serious, the device -- which helps patients breathe more easily -- was being used for up to 16 hours a day on the doctor's advice.\n\nThree days after he was discharged, Suri was delirious, struggling to eat, and told Raj he thought he was close to the end. Raj believes this was because his brain was being starved of oxygen.\n\nThe recovery\n\nThe following day, Dr. Thacker called with the news that Suri's coronavirus test had come back positive. At that point, many British GPs like Thacker were struggling to get hold of full personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a full-length gown and gloves.\n\nWithout PPE, it was unsafe for Thacker to make a home visit to coronavirus patients like Suri. \"If I went there and I got it, then not only are my family at risk, but so are my patients if I returned to the surgery,\" he told CNN.\n\nInstead he checked the Google spreadsheet, and recommended an antibiotic for a secondary lung infection Suri had developed. The GP also advised that Suri should be helped to lie on his stomach for a number of hours a day -- a practice known as prone positioning. Doctors have found that placing the sickest coronavirus patients on their stomachs can help increase the amount of oxygen getting into their lungs.\n\nImage from a zoom call between Suri Nathwani (bottom) and his relatives in the US and the UK as he recovered from coronavirus.\n\nSuri Nathwani celebrating his 80th birthday with his grandchildren in August 2018.\n\nKnowing the seriousness of Suri's condition, Thacker said a DNR notice was issued for the family's address so that any paramedics who were sent there knew not to resuscitate the man, since \"the outcome is going to be rather poor.\"\n\nThankfully, it was not needed. Under his son's watchful eye, Suri gradually began to recover. Raj says he knew his father was on the road to recovery when he became strong enough to nag him. \"He began whingeing and said his tea was badly made. He then asked for some pizza and chips,\" Raj said.\n\nEventually, Suri was given the all-clear, and by last week, he was walking the length of his garden with the help of a zimmer frame, or walker -- inspired by Capt. Tom Moore, the 100-year-old British war veteran who has raised millions of pounds for the UK's National Health Service by walking 100 laps of his garden.\n\n\"We truly had an action and 'go-to' team on tap that I trusted,\" Raj said, adding he did not have to rely on \"Dr. Google,\" because he had real doctors nearby to help.\n\nHe said he appreciates that he and his father were in a more privileged position than many in the UK, where the virus is disproportionately affecting black and ethnic minority communities.\n\nThacker, who has had a number of patients die of Covid-19, says he cannot put his finger on exactly what worked for Suri.\n\n\"Whether it was the family caring for him, or the available bio-data that made the difference -- we don't know,\" he said, adding: \"Perhaps it was just luck and not quite his time to go.\"\n\nIn the darkest moments, sometimes a plan of action and a little luck are the only things people have."}

Regardless of her intentions, though, her comments were laden with inaccuracies.\n\nMcEnany misquoted an FBI agent's written comment about former national security adviser Michael Flynn . She mischaracterized a Friday tweet by President Donald Trump about protesters in Michigan. She gave an inflated figure for the cost of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. And she said Mueller offered a \"complete and total exoneration\" of the President, something Mueller explicitly said he was not doing.\n\nMcEnany also added confusion to an already-confusing situation surrounding the President's statements about whether the coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory.\n\nMcEnany defends Flynn by misquoting FBI notes\n\nAfter taking questions about coronavirus, McEnany turned to the legal saga of Michael Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser who resigned after a few weeks on the job in 2017 and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his Russian contacts.\n\nAs part of his plea bargain, Flynn cooperated extensively with special counsel Robert Mueller, but he's back in Trump's good graces after publicly disavowing his guilty plea and accusing the Justice Department of anti-Trump misconduct.\n\nTrump now says he is considering a pardon for Flynn, and ramped up his pro-Flynn rhetoric this week by seizing on a batch of newly unsealed documents that he says provide explosive new reasons to doubt Flynn's prosecution.\n\nMcEnany referred to some of those documents Friday.\n\n\"We have a handwritten FBI note that says, quote, 'we need to get Flynn to lie,' quote, and get him fired,\" McEnany said. \"There is an unfair target on the back of General Michael Flynn. It should concern every American, anytime there is a partisan pursuit of an individual.\"\n\nFacts First: The FBI notes do raise serious new questions about the Flynn case, but McEnany misquoted them in a way that makes them look much more damning than they actually are. She ignored parts of the notes that undercut Trump's cherry-picked narrative, and added the phrase \"we need\" before \"to get him to lie,\" even though she said it was a word-for-word quote.\n\nAlso, McEnany's claims that Flynn was politically targeted are not supported by the facts. A federal judge recently ruled that there wasn't a partisan plot against Flynn, and the Justice Department watchdog concluded that the Flynn investigation was opened without bias.\n\nCNN examined many of the facts of Flynn's case on Thursday after Trump made a series of similarly inaccurate and false claims.\n\nThe newly unsealed files -- FBI emails and handwritten notes -- shed new light on how FBI officials carefully prepared to interview Flynn in January 2017, when he was national security adviser. Investigators had reviewed US intelligence intercepts of Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador, and those transcripts contradicted public comments from several top Trump officials that Flynn never discussed sanctions with the Russians.\n\nFlynn supporters point to one note where an FBI official asks, \"What's our goal? Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?\"\n\nAt the press briefing on Friday, McEnany's misquote of the line makes it look like the FBI was dead-set on coercing Flynn to lie.\n\nA closer examination of the documents shows this is not necessarily the case. The newly public information is not a clear-cut breakthrough for Flynn. Other notes reveal that the FBI planned to refresh Flynn's memory to give him a chance to correct his statement and potentially avoid a criminal charge.\n\nAdditionally, Flynn testified in 2018 that he knew it was a crime when he lied to the FBI agents, that he didn't think his rights had been violated, and that he didn't want to challenge the circumstances of his interview. He has since reversed course and is trying to withdraw his guilty plea, which requires a judge's approval.\n\nThe judge overseeing Flynn's case has previously rejected many of the allegations that McEnany and Trump are now championing. The judge said in a December ruling that \"the record proves\" that Flynn wasn't ambushed by the FBI as part of some caper orchestrated by anti-Trump partisans.\n\nThe Justice Department inspector general also concluded in a sweeping report that there were legitimate reasons to open the Russia investigation in 2016, which led to Flynn's FBI interview. The inspector general also said he didn't find proof that the top FBI officials who opened the Flynn investigation were motivated by political bias.\n\nMcEnany exaggerates the cost and outcome of the Mueller investigation\n\nIn discussing Flynn, McEnany said: \"I've seen a whole lot of scant information about Michael Flynn, when there was speculation about Russia, Russia, Russia, culminating in $40 million of taxpayer money being lost in a complete and total exoneration of President Trump.\"\n\nFacts First: McEnany exaggerated both the outcome of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and its cost. Mueller explicitly said that he was not giving the President a complete exoneration. And the investigation actually cost $32 million, according to McEnany exaggerated both the outcome of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and its cost. Mueller explicitly said that he was not giving the President a complete exoneration. And the investigation actually cost $32 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department.\n\nMueller's report said that the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign \"coordinated or conspired\" with Russia's election interference. The report did, however, lay out a case that Trump may have committed obstruction of justice. It explained that Mueller would abide by a Justice Department policy that holds that a sitting President cannot be indicted.\n\n\"... while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\" the report said.\n\nWhen Mueller was asked by House Judiciary chairman Jerry Nadler during congressional testimony in July 2019 if he \"totally exonerate(d) the President,\" Mueller simply said, \"No.\"\n\nMcEnany wrongly describes Trump's tweet about Michigan protesters\n\nMcEnany was asked about Trump's tweet on Friday morning about protesters in Michigan who oppose the state's emergency pandemic restrictions.\n\nTrump wrote : \"The Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire. These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal.\"\n\nA reporter asked McEnany if the \"very good people\" remark was referring specifically to armed militia members who crowded into the state Capitol on Thursday.\n\nMcEnany responded: \"The President was referencing generally that in this country you have a First Amendment right to protest.\"\n\nFacts First: Trump's tweet did not make any reference to the First Amendment or the general right to protest. He simply praised opponents of the restrictions -- though he did not specify whether he was referring to armed militia members or any of the others -- and urged Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to make concessions to them.\n\nTrump and the intelligence community's stance on coronavirus\n\nWhen asked about a New York Times report that senior Trump administration officials have pushed intelligence agencies to find evidence supporting the theory that Covid-19 originated in a Wuhan laboratory, McEnany responded, \"I can assure you that no one is pressing the intelligence community to come to a determination.\"\n\nMcEnany attempted to further clarify the White House's stance on the origins of the outbreak by suggesting that the President and the intelligence community are in agreement, despite apparent contradictions in recent statements.\n\nReferring to a statement the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a few hours before the President took questions Thursday at the White House on coronavirus, McEnany added, \"The intelligence community statement stands. It's in perfect concert with what the President said.\"\n\nFacts First: It's a stretch to say the intelligence community It's a stretch to say the intelligence community statement and the President's recent remarks on the origin of the novel coronavirus were in \"perfect\" alignment. The President on Thursday told the press, without providing details, that he has seen evidence that gives him a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of the novel coronavirus. However, the public statement from ODNI said that no such assessment about the outbreak's origins has been made as they continue to \"rigorously examine\" the origins of the outbreak.\n\nWhile the intelligence community is looking into whether the outbreak was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, the statement released by the ODNI, on behalf of the entire intelligence community, made it clear they do not have enough information to confidently assess whether that was the case or if the pandemic began \"through contact with infected animals.\"\n\nThe statement also noted that the intelligence community \"concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.\"\n\nTwo weeks earlier, when asked about concerns the virus was manmade or otherwise came out of a laboratory in China, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said the evolution of the virus is \"totally consistent with a jump of a species from an animal to a human.\""}

He was 56.\n\nIn January 2019, Lloyd was diagnosed with cancer, after doctors discovered an inoperable brain tumor that had metastasized from his lungs. A representative for the actor confirmed his death to EW.\n\nSam Lloyd was a steady onscreen presence for three decades, appearing in a litany of movies and TV shows, including Cougar Town, Modern Family, Desperate Housewives, The West Wing, and Galaxy Quest. He came from an acting family. His father Sam Lloyd III was also an actor, and he is the nephew of Back to the Future's Christopher Lloyd. He appeared with the latter multiple times, guest-starring together on Malcolm in the Middle and The West Wing.\n\nLloyd was beloved for his portrayal of singing lawyer Ted Buckland on NBC's Scrubs, which he played in 95 episodes and reprised on ABC's Cougar Town. He had a memorable extended role as Dr. Albert Goldfine, Bree's (Marcia Cross) marriage counselor, on Desperate Housewives. Seinfeld fans will also recognize him as Ricky, the guy who became obsessed with Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and designed mannequins that resembled her after meeting her on the subway.

In today’s edition, French Montana returns to his Coke Boys roots, Lori McKenna doles out life advice, Thom Yorke delivers moody existentialism, Machine Gun Kelly continues his foray into pop-punk, and Luke Combs adds to the quarantine tune pile.\n\n“Cold”— French Montana (feat. Tory Lanez)\n\nNew York rapper French Montana was recently clowned for saying that he had more anthems than Kendrick Lamar, but if you replace the word “anthems” with “club hits'' he’s not lying. Even Lamar’s biggest single “HUMBLE'' can't get a party going the way “Pop That” can. Montana’s new track with rapper Tory Lanez (who he recently had a semi-official VERZUZ battle with) takes him back to his Coke Boys roots with a dope staccato hook about wheeling and dealing. It’s time to show some respect to the only rapper who has spent nearly a decade providing a steady stream of songs to take shots and/or twerk to — even if those things can only be done at home right now. –Marcus Jones\n\n\"When You're My Age\" – Lori McKenna\n\nThe Massachusetts native is squarely in her wheelhouse with this new single, another in her growing repertoire of tear-jerking life advice ballads. With vocal help from her Love Junkies co-conspirators Hillary Lindsey and Liz Rose, McKenna muses to a younger person, \"When you're my age/I hope the world is kinder/Than it seems to be right now/And I hope the front page/Isn't just a reminder/Of how we keep letting each other down.\" It also observes that no matter how old the narrator's child gets, they will always be the baby. Cue the Kleenex. The poignant tune is the first preview for the Grammy and CMA-winning singer-songwriter's upcoming Dave Cobb-produced album The Balladeer, out July 24. –Sarah Rodman\n\n\"Plasticine\" – Thom Yorke\n\nThis week, a scraggly-looking (hey, who isn't right now?) Thom Yorke appeared from his basement on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to serenade us with the spooky dystopia of a new song called \"Plasticine Figures.\" It comes with a few typical Yorkeian hallmarks: glum piano riff, unconventional chord progression, lyrics that drip with existential dread. \"Most malleable/Plasticine figures/Mould to suit your taste/Happy to serve/Happy to linger/While you make up your face,\" broods the Radiohead frontman. Is he singing about power structures that shape our everyday lives? The hourly Amazon employees currently toiling away at a warehouse? The fact that he's been playing with putty during isolation? Like most of Yorke's songwriting, the meaning remains elusive. —Alex Suskind\n\n\"Bloody Valentine\" — Machine Gun Kelly\n\nMusic-wise, Machine Gun Kelly was known as a talented rapper who sometimes punched a little above his weight by feuding with Eminem. But through the surprise success of his Lockdown Sessions on YouTube, covering songs like Paramore’s “Misery Business,” the Cleveland artist has shown his true destiny may be bringing pop-punk back. Executive produced by Travis Barker, this new single is propulsive lovelorn emo goodness that Kelly is right to say is perfect to “air drum in your room blasting it loud as f— at least once.” —MJ\n\n\"Six Feet Apart\" – Luke Combs\n\nThe country hitmaker makes socially distanced lemonade out of quarantine lemons with this wistful track about what we'll do when we can be closer to each other. Among those options: hugging, shaking hands, going to shows and ballgames, and hitting the bars and restaurants with friends and family. Hopefully, this tune will one day fall squarely in the \"remember when\" category at Combs' shows. —SR\n\nRelated content:"}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that adults over 65 are at a higher risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19.\n\n\"Based on all the information that we have today, probably people over 60 with preexisting conditions can't go, for sure, no matter what their titles are,\" the second general manager said. \"Whether it's a father of the star player or whether it's the general manager of the team, they can't go there.\"\n\nThe first general manager said these issues apply to staff beyond coaches.\n\n\"I worry about those guys,\" the general manager said. \"That's an exposure that I don't think we can afford.\"\n\nThe first GM continued, saying that when the term \"essential\" is considered, it has to be defined what that individual is essential for: player health, broadcasting the game or other elements of behind-the-scenes production?\n\n\"The one area you don't want to skimp on is the medical. The coaching part of it, you could probably get by with a head coach, that's it.\" an NBA general manager, on determining essential personnel if the 2019-20 season resumes\n\nBut if \"essential\" is centered only on player health and wellness, then several general managers said they would want the bulk of their medical and athletic training staffs to be on site. Answering who else should be present isn't as clear -- and the possible answers could create discomfort among staffers who feel their job security is on the line, especially during a period of heavy financial losses when teams are cutting salary, furloughing employees or even laying them off.\n\n\"When you start defining essential personnel and you're creating a list of essential and non-essential, you think the owner's not going to ask for that list?\" one veteran athletic training official said. \"You think the owner's not going to say, 'Do we need three video interns? Do we need three front-office interns to go and get coffee?\"\n\nAs the first general manager said, \"We're going to have to get comfortable with the fact that there are going to be some people getting their feelings hurt that they're not essential, and that's OK.\"\n\nA common answer for determining essential staff comes back to the concept of the traveling party. Several general managers said their traveling party consisted of about 40-50 people, with more during the playoffs.\n\nBut with careful calculations, that number could be cut in half, a third general manager said, though exactly how a team would do so remains unclear.\n\n\"The one area you don't want to skimp on is the medical,\" another general manager said. \"The coaching part of it, you could probably get by with a head coach, that's it.\"\n\nIn the end, the question of who is or isn't essential is complicated and deeply nuanced.\n\n\"Why don't you find the first person that doesn't see themselves as essential,\" one veteran athletic training official asked, half-kidding, \"and let me know who all that would be.\""}

(2:14)\n\nA federal judge in California ruled in favor of the United States Soccer Federation on most of the key points in the ongoing wage discrimination lawsuit brought by members of the U.S. women's national team player pool, dealing a potentially fatal setback to the players in the high-profile case.\n\nPlayers based the lawsuit filed last year on two grounds: first, that U.S. Soccer violated the Equal Pay Act by paying them less than members of the men's national team; and second, that the federation discriminated against them under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, specifically with regard to workplace conditions.\n\nJudge R. Gary Klausner on Friday ruled for U.S. Soccer's motion for summary judgment with regard to the Equal Pay Act, stating in his decision that the players \"have not demonstrated a triable issue that WNT players are paid less than MNT players.\"\n\nSome prominent members of the women's national team reacted to the decision on social media Friday.\n\nWe will never stop fighting for EQUALITY. — Megan Rapinoe (@mPinoe) May 2, 2020\n\nWe will continue on in the fight for equal pay. https://t.co/GmI16NssIh — Christen Press (@ChristenPress) May 1, 2020\n\nKlausner's ruling was informed by the federation's contention that women's players were paid more in total and on a per-game basis than their male counterparts were during the period in question. Friday's ruling cited as undisputed fact that from 2015 to 2019, the women's national team averaged $220,747 per game in total payments (for a total of $24.5 million), while the men's national team averaged $212,639 per game in total payments (for a total of $18.5 million).\n\nThose figures do not include compensation women's players receive from U.S. Soccer for play in the National Women's Soccer League.\n\nIn certifying Carli Lloyd, Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Becky Sauerbrunn as class representatives in the suit in November, the court ruled against U.S. Soccer's reliance on total compensation. The federation argued at the time that the four players lacked standing because they earned more in total than male counterparts. In siding with the plaintiffs at that time, Klausner cited precedent that total compensation alone was insufficient -- a woman could earn more in total but still be paid at a lesser rate to violate the Equal Pay Act.\n\nBut Friday's ruling stated that the plaintiffs had failed in the intervening months to further establish that they earned more in total compensation \"due solely, or in material part, to the WNT working more than the MNT.\"\n\nInstead, the differences in collective bargaining agreements between the women's team and the men's team proved to be the undoing of the EPA claims.\n\nKlausner effectively concluded that differences in payment structure were the result of choices made by the women's players and their union -- including guaranteed annual salaries of at least $100,000 for 20 contracted players -- and not discrimination by the federation.\n\nThe 32-page ruling went through a detailed history of the collective bargaining process that led to the current CBA between U.S. Soccer and the USWNTPA that was signed in 2017. Klausner noted that representatives for the players rejected a pay-for-play model identical to the men early in those negotiations in 2016. In later negotiations, the players offered a counterproposal with lesser bonuses than the federation's offer in exchange for more contracted players and higher base salaries -- benefits not part of the CBA between U.S. Soccer and the men's union.\n\nTherefore, while the women's players argued that, after winning the World Cup in 2015 and 2019, they would have made more money under the terms of a men's CBA, which offered higher game bonuses, the court noted that there was \"indisputably economic value\" to the guarantees included only in the women's CBA.\n\n\"Merely comparing what WNT players received under their own CBA with what they would have received under the MNT CBA discounts the value that the team placed on the guaranteed benefits they received under their agreement,\" the ruling stated, \"which they opted for at the expense of higher performance-based bonuses.\"\n\nU.S. Soccer relied almost exclusively on that line of argument after its inflammatory filings in March that led to the resignation of Carlos Cordeiro as president and apologies from his successor, Cindy Parlow Cone. In those filings as part of the summary judgment process, U.S. Soccer argued that the women's players did not meet EPA requirements for performing equal work because it alleged they were physically inferior to men's players and that the women's game carried less responsibility than the men's game.\n\nThe court's decision Friday also granted in part U.S. Soccer's motion for summary judgment with regard to the Title VII claims, ruling that the federation did not discriminate against players by having them play more games on artificial turf than men's players during the period in question.\n\nThe bulk of the games in question came during the Victory Tour after the 2015 Women's World Cup, which under FIFA management was played entirely on artificial turf in Canada. The U.S. played seven games on artificial turf in the 10-game tour, including a game in Hawaii that was canceled because of what were deemed unsafe field conditions in Aloha Stadium. Rapinoe tore her ACL in practice two days prior.\n\nBut Klausner ruled that the federation was not acting in a discriminatory manner because of its professed intent \"to spread National Team games across various cities in various regions of the country, the relatively large number of games required to be played in a relatively short period of time during fall and winter, and the desire to prioritize venues with grass fields for 2016 in preparation for the 2016 Olympics.\"\n\nThe women's team also played three games on artificial turf in the summer and fall of 2017.\n\nKlausner accepted as legitimate the federation's contention that it did not anticipate generating enough revenue from those games to merit installing temporary grass fields. He noted \"the issue to be decided in this case is not whether USSF employed good management practices but whether it discriminated against Plaintiffs.\"\n\nThe court left unsettled only the plaintiffs' Title VII claims regarding discrimination in charter flights and hotel accommodations and medical and training support.\n\nA spokesperson for the players indicated they planned to appeal.\n\n\"We are shocked and disappointed with today's decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay,\" said Molly Levinson, spokesperson for the plaintiffs. \"We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.\n\n\"We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them. We will appeal and press on. Words cannot express our gratitude to all who support us.\"\n\nParlow Cone has said she hopes the suit can settle before a trial.\n\n\"We look forward to working with the women's national team to chart a positive path forward to grow the game,'' the USSF said in a statement. \"We are committed to continuing that work to ensure our women's national team remains the best in the world.''\n\nEarlier Friday, the women asked that Parlow Cone be included as a trial witness.

(2:27)\n\nTexas A&M quarterback Kellen Mond believes his team is on the verge of making a leap in 2020 like LSU did last season, when the Tigers went from 10-3 to a 15-0 national title campaign.\n\n\"We really haven't won the big-time games yet,\" Mond told The Dallas Morning News for a story published Friday. \"In some of those games, most of those games, we've been close, but we always fall short. But we have to be able to get over that hump.\n\n\"A lot of people emphasize that the last 2% is the hardest. I feel like we're at the last 2% from being a good team to being elite.\"\n\nThe Aggies are coming off an 8-5 season in which they lost to Clemson, Alabama and LSU by double digits when each was ranked No. 1.\n\nThat includes a 50-7 blowout defeat to LSU, but Mond also was part of a seven-overtime win over the Tigers in 2018, so he saw the leap they took firsthand.\n\n\"It's kind of weird being able to play all those guys and seeing what kind of change LSU made,\" Mond said. \"They were a good team the year we beat them, but becoming an elite team and one of the best teams of all time this past year just kind of shows the work they put in.\"\n\nMond hopes the lesson the Aggies take is that \"it only takes one year\" to show vast improvement.\n\nTexas A&M has reasons to believe a jump is possible. The Aggies played 19 true freshmen last year, they are getting 17 starters back, and coach Jimbo Fisher signed another top-10 recruiting class. They were No. 11 in ESPN's early top 25 in February, and ESPN's Football Power Index gives them a 2% chance of making the College Football Playoff.\n\nMond, who said he is working on his deep-ball accuracy, believes the Aggies have the makings of a special team in 2020.\n\n\"We have a lot of seniors on our team and a lot of guys coming back,\" Mond told the newspaper. \"Usually when you have seniors, you have guys who have played one or two years, but our seniors, we've been playing since we were freshmen, since 17 or 18 years old in college, so we have a lot of games under our belt and a lot of experience.\""}

(2:28)\n\nAs he enters a season full of unknowns, New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick is still considered a constant by oddsmakers. Caesars Sportsbook has posted Belichick as a 7-1 favorite to win the Coach of the Year award.\n\nTom Brady signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this offseason after a 20-year run with Belichick, leaving the Pats with inexperienced options or possibly a free agent at quarterback.\n\n\"If [Belichick] takes that roster and wins that division, and no other team goes 16-0, how do you give it to somebody else?\" Caesars Sportsbook director of trading Jeff Davis told ESPN. \"The only way he doesn't get it is if one of the teams that was terrible last year makes the playoffs.\"\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys were not terrible last season but did underachieve, finishing 8-8 and missing the playoffs, which led to the firing of coach Jason Garrett. Mike McCarthy now grabs the reins for the odds-on NFC East betting favorite (-105), and he is the second favorite to win the award at 9-1.\n\n\"I find it the most interesting betting market because it's not remotely related to how good of a coach you are. Mike McCarthy is second on the list and he's not in the top 20 in the NFL of pure coaching ability,\" Davis said. \"If every guy gets the same roster, is Mike McCarthy going to be the second choice? No.\"\n\nDavis stressed the critical roles that perception and expectations play. For example, Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur is tied for the longest odds at 100-1, after winning an NFC-high 13 games in his rookie season. \"He can only win if they go 16-0 or 15-1 and that roster can't do that,\" Davis said.\n\nThis is the first year Nevada Gaming approved betting on Coach of the Year, as well as for Offensive Rookie of the Year. Joe Burrow, the No. 1 overall pick who is expected to open the season as the Cincinnati Bengals' starter, is the favorite for that award at 3-1.\n\n\"I'd rather take a bet at Burrow at 3-1 than be [liable] on one of these wide receivers or running backs at 15-1. Running backs have won it twice as much as quarterbacks and receivers combined,\" Davis said, explaining why he's offering such high odds for Burrow, whereas most other sportsbooks have him priced between 2-1 and 5-2. \"Your learning curve from college to pro is the smallest at running back.\"\n\nBut recent rookie quarterbacks have seemingly made the transition more smoothly, once more college football programs started adopting the spread offense. In the past 17 seasons, eight quarterbacks have earned the offensive rookie honors.\n\nHowever, while Burrow probably will have plenty of opportunity, the same cannot be said for the other three quarterbacks drafted in the first round. Tua Tagovailoa is 10-1, Justin Herbert is 30-1 and Jordan Love has 200-1 odds. None is projected to start his team's season opener.\n\nKansas City Chiefs running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire is the second favorite at 11-2.\n\n\"He's a first-round pick and has a lot of opportunity with a Super Bowl-winning team and the best offense in the league,\" Caesars Sportsbook oddsmaker Alan Berg told ESPN.\n\nLong shots have won recent football awards. Reigning NFL MVP Lamar Jackson had 50-1 odds last summer and Patrick Mahomes had 100-1 odds for his award-winning 2018 season.\n\nThe Heisman Trophy has also cashed some impressive tickets. When Jackson won with Louisville, he was once offered at 100-1 odds. Burrow just capped off a 200-1 Heisman campaign with LSU.\n\nOddsmakers are on alert for both of these new additions to the betting menu, especially with scoring continuing to rise. Over the past decade, three rookies drafted outside the first round still managed to win Offensive Rookie of the Year.\n\n\"Usage in Week 1 is going to blow up the market big-time,\" Davis said."}

Yes, the next chapter of Assassin’s Creed focuses on the Viking Age, with all the axes, runes, and furs that you could wish for. And, based on how Assassin’s Creed Odyssey played out, we wouldn’t be surprised if we see more than a little Norse mythology in its world, too.\n\nLoading\n\nGod of War\n\nLoading\n\nFor Honor\n\nLoading\n\nNorthgard\n\n6 IMAGES\n\nTotal War Saga: Thrones of Britannia\n\nThe Banner Saga 3 Review Screens 13 IMAGES\n\nThe Banner Saga\n\nLoading\n\nHellblade: Senua's Sacrifice\n\nWhile release day is still a way off, you don’t have to wait months to get your Viking fix. There have been some truly fantastic games based on Norse mythology and culture over the last few years, ranging from historically accurate strategy games to action epics that fully embrace the rich folklore of the era. These are the best Viking games featuring the era’s most iconic elements that you can play in preparation for Assassin's Creed Valhalla.Norse mythology - the Aesir pantheon, Nine Worlds, Jörmungandr the World Serpent, and so forth - is a key component of the Viking Age. 2018’s God of War is a grimdark love letter to that mythology, one that makes clever use of those myths and characters to tell an intricate, original story. Interestingly, God of War opts to explore elements of Norse Paganism that have been less represented in popular culture - the heavyweights of Thor and Odin are unseen background players, while lesser figures like Thor’s sons Magni and Modi feature prominently - making it an ideal starting point to expand your knowledge of Viking religion.While God of War is set in the fictional realms where many of these myths take place, its gameplay and plot elegantly mirrors the broader strokes of the Viking Age. That era of human history saw the Norsemen of Scandinavia leave their borders and explore new lands, raiding and expanding into Iceland, Greenland, and Europe. In God of War, an older Kratos has left Ancient Greece behind, embarking on an unfamiliar journey where he must adapt to both the needs of his son and the strange new realms that he travels through.Assassin's Creed Valhalla is not the first time that Ubisoft has tackled Vikings – they’re one of the main factions in the developer’s medieval battler, For Honor. While they’re very much a pop-fiction version of Vikings - we’re talking full horned helmets, furs, coloured war paint, the works - For Honor’s Norsemen are still more grounded than many other gaming depictions. Don’t expect Kratos’ magical axe or the godly powers of Jotun’s Thora, as For Honor eschews mythology in favour of gritty hand-to-hand combat.The detailed fight mechanics of For Honor may not be the most ‘realistic’ combat engine, but they do capture the ruthlessness of raider strategy. The Vikings are believed to have been some of history’s fiercest warriors, fuelled by their belief that dying transported them to the heavenly Valhalla, and For Honor certainly captures that dedication to battle.While there’s not a hidden blade or stealth kill in sight, the intricate parrying system does provide a battle experience with a similar amount of depth to the newer Assassin’s Creed combat mechanics. Also, For Honor’s Vikings can chokeslam an enemy and then decapitate them with an axe, which just screams “For the glory of Valhalla” and all that, yeah?If you’ve ever looked at a map of the areas raided by Vikings, you’ll have noticed that they’re almost all in the upper regions of the northern hemisphere. With raids keeping them away from their homelands for months at a time, this meant that the Norsemen frequently battled for survival against the elements. That fight is at the heart of Northgard, a strategy game that sees you guiding a clan to victory while the seasons change around you - which creates unique strategic challenges to overcome. Come winter, food production plummets, while wood consumption skyrockets. Your warriors fight poorly in the snow, making violent expansion and defence a struggle. To survive, you have to prepare.Forward thinking is vital to almost every RTS, but the way that Northgard spins planning around the seasons helps anchor it in the world of Viking raiders. This gruelling nuance is offset by an embracement of mythology - you’ll meet jötnar (giants), valkyries, kobolds (somewhere between a goblin and a fairy), and undead draugr on your journey - meaning there’s always something interesting to see on the far side of winter.With not a god, draugr, or lightning-wrapped hammer in sight, Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia is a grand strategy game that focuses on a more historically accurate representation of Viking strategy and expansion. Plus it all takes place in the same setting as Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, so a campaign is good research for the journey ahead.Set in 878AD, after their defeat at the hands of King Alfred, you choose one of two varieties of Vikings - the land-based Grand Army or the ocean-focused Sea Kings - and proceed to raid, pillage, and eventually settle as much of Britain as you can. Or, you can opt to defend the isles from the Vikings by playing as the Saxons or Gaelic clans, but that’s likely not your intention if you’re reading this.Conquering the Saxon and Gaelic factions on Thrones of Britannia’s detailed map requires savvy strategies, from the use of the Norsemen’s famous Longships in naval battles, to fully embracing the slave trade if you’re comfortable really throwing ethics out the window. You can also tactically deploy the iconic berserkers; warriors clad in furs who worked themselves into a terrifying frenzy before battle. Historic texts suggest that they believed their power was drawn from bears, and so they snarled and howled as they fought. The image of the berserker has influenced many video game characters - God of War’s Kratos among them - but Thrones of Britannia shows you the historical origins of one of pop-cultures most recognisable warrior archetypes.While the Vikings were famous for plundering and fighting, they were also a people with a strong love of storytelling. The Banner Saga is an emotional RPG trilogy that pulls its inspirations from the great Norse sagas, particularly their epic scale and morally-ambiguous heroes.The series asks you to oversee a caravan of Vikings travelling through a myth-like world that’s under threat from the terrifying Dredge. Think of it like Game of Thrones - shocking twists, unstoppable evil, and gradually expanding scope included - but with the weight of responsibility entirely on your shoulders instead of George RR Martin’s.Drawn in a beautiful style reminiscent of Disney’s early animated movies, The Banner Saga is always striking to play, from its delicately wrought conversational segments to the tense turn-based tactical battles that evoke the strategic satisfaction of XCOM and the fantastical heroism of Dragon Age. The trilogy forces you to make tough decisions at almost every turn, some of which put the moral quandaries of even The Witcher to shame, and the saves that carry your choices from one game to the next makes its finale all the more satisfying (or, indeed, heartbreaking).Similar to the trends of God of War and The Banner Saga, Hellblade uses the Norse mythos to tell a complex, emotionally devastating story that deals with themes of mortality, trauma, survival, and change. Its protagonist Senua is not actually a Viking - she instead belongs to a Gaelic Pict confederation, hailing from what we now know as Scotland - but her journey takes her into the Norse underworld of Helheim on a quest to defy the god of death itself. Her journey is filled with monsterous foes, but Hellblade’s true antagonist is Senua’s fracturing psyche - and overcoming that mental trauma is the only way Senua can succeed.That narrative is built on the bones of a hack-and-slash action game, its brutal violence interspersed with clever puzzles, making Hellblade an ideal second course if you’ve already tackled God of War and are hungry for more. It’s a heavy, unrelenting journey, but certainly one worth taking.\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla releases Holiday 2020, which means you've still got several months to try out a few of our Viking game suggestions and refresh you knowledge of all things Norse.

This config boasts a 9th gen Intel Core i7 processor and the newest RTX 2080 SUPER video card. It's about 10% more powerful than the non-SUPER model and considerably more powerful than the GTX 1080 Ti.Save $27 and a storage boost from 1TB to 2TB by going with the older chassis.If you want upgrade the RAM and hard drive yourself, you can save alot of money compared to adding pre-configured upgrades.It really comes down to aeshetics. Like the new R9 chassis, the R8 features easy toolless entry. Swapping components doesn't void the warranty.AMD has been giving Intel a run for its money. The new AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-core processor is comparable to the Intel Core i7-9700, both in terms of gaming and workstation performance. It's paired with an RX 5700 XT video card, which is on par with the RTX 2070.If you want a new 2019 model AND a tremendous value, then take a look at this Dell G5 gaming desktop. This is a customizable config so you can pick and choose your preferred combination of components. The config we chose gives you a 9th generation Intel Core i5 6-core processor and a powerful RTX 2070 SUPER video card for about $1000. That's hard to beat. Despite the fact that the G5 model is not as pricey as Alienware, it still boasts a toolless chassis so you can easily upgrade your memory and hard drive.You can upgrade to a gaming-worthy Intel Core i5-9600K processor for $100.If gaming isn't your primary reason for getting a PC then check this excellent deal out. This Iaptop weighs only 4 pounds (identical to the MacBook 15\") and is equipped with the newest 10 generation Intel Core i7 processor. You also get the Iris Plus onboard GPU, which is leagues better than the Intel UHD graphics and finally on par with the AMD Vega graphics. Rounding out the specs are 8GB of RAM and a generous 512GB SSD.The \"R2\" is the latest redesign of the very well rated m15 laptop. It still weighs under 5 pounds (4.8lbs) and is a vast improvement over the older bulkier Alienware laptops of the past.. This laptop is outfitted with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. I'd also recommend upgrading the monitor to a 144Hz 9ms capable panel if you plan to play FPS games.The m17 was the first Alienware 17\" laptop to weigh in at under 6 pounds.The model has been upgraded with dual 512GB of SSD storage (1TB total) and a more powerful RTX 2070 Max-Q video card. The RTX 2070 is almost as powerful as last year's GTX 1080 (the previous mobile GPU champ) and will crush any game at 1080p. This is a good laptop to get if you plan on using it for VR or gaming on a higher res external monitor.For those of you who are on a tighter budget, the GTX 1660 Ti is still a capable video card that can power most games at 1080p. It's superior in performance to the GTX 1060. You can also add in your own M.2 SSD drive later if you don't want to upgrade from Dell.Same as the previous deal but with a 17\" display instead of 15\".Eric Song is IGN's deal curator and spends 25% of his pay on stuff he posts."}

Nintendo has sold about 50 million Switches, surpassing the SNES in just two years and quadrupling the total number of Wii U consoles ever sold. Whether your jam is Animal Crossing , the Spiro Reignited Trilogy , or a sublime session of Minecraft , you no doubt want to keep your Switch safe and secure when you’re on the go. That’s where cases come in.\n\nTL;DR – These are the Best Nintendo Switch Cases:\n\n1.

Some emphasize protection, with hard-shell enclosures you can drive a Jeep over. Others allow on-the-go charging, add some style-first flair, or give you additional room for other mobile gadgets. Whatever you need, you’ll find the best cases that Switch accessory makers have to offer down below. And when you’re ready to shop, be sure to read the end of the article, where I’ve put together a buying guide that highlights what you should keep in mind when you look for your next Switch case.Carrying cases don’t need to be pricey, and the AmazonBasics product line is proof. This carrying case does pretty much everything that more expensive models do for pennies on the dollar. The form-fitting case tightly hugs your Switch with no room to spare around the sides, with a mesh pocket on top for cords or other (very) small accessories.It features a flip-down game cartridge sleeve that holds 10 games and does double-duty as a screen protector. And if all that’s not enough, there’s a built-in gaming stand to prop up the Switch when you’re ready to play. The case comes in black, red, or neon yellow.Looking for a slimline case that won’t take up a lot of room in your backpack? You’d be hard-pressed to find a thinner carrying case for your Switch than this model from tomtoc. Just 1.18 inches thick at the screen (it bulges to accommodate the Joy-Cons), it’s barely larger than the Switch itself. Yet this hardshell case is more than rigid enough to buffer the buttons and joysticks, so nothing can put pressure on the controls, and tomtoc claims the case passes military-grade drop tests without damaging the contents.The tomtoc case includes a 10-game cartridge sleeve that serves as a screen protector, and on the outside, features a removable wrist strap. You can choose from among five colors, including gray, black, pink, red, and camo.Want to take it all with you? The Zadii Hard Carrying Case holds the console, charging dock, power adapter, Joy-Con grip, straps, cables, and more. Everything fits in its own perfectly sized cut-out in thick, protective foam, which makes it feel like you’re transporting a nuclear weapon. And there’s a lot of room to spare – the case holds cables and a formidable 21 game cartridges as well.All that foam makes this an ideal way to transport your entire Switch system on a long trip. It has a luggage-like handle as well as a removable shoulder strap.Like Zadii’s Hard Carrying Case, the PowerA Everywhere Messenger Bag can hold pretty much everything Switch-related. Your console, charging dock, cables, Joy-Con grip, and more slip effortlessly into this case. But instead of the industrial look of a hardshell case like the Zadii, this is a slim and attractive messenger bag, fitted with a handle on top and a detachable shoulder strap for, you know, slinging it over your shoulder.Inside, the messenger bag is designed with the Switch in mind, with pouches and compartments neatly laid out for each component. The bag even comes with a slim carrying case just for the console and Joy-Cons. It keeps the screen scratch-free while in the bag, and you can travel separately with just that smaller case if you need to.Sometimes you want a carrying case that doesn’t look like you’re carrying a gaming console around, and the Victoriatourist Switch Travel Bag is as discreet as they come. It looks like a typical backpack or shoulder bag, with an understated gray fabric finish and aesthetic that looks like, if it were a little larger, it could be holding a laptop.Even so, it has padded pockets and compartments for the whole system, including the console, Joy-Cons, dock, cables, and power adapter. And there are still compartments left over to hold a small tablet, smartphone, and other accessories. While the bag has cable routing for a power bank and an external USB port, you’ll need to add your own battery to charge the Switch on the go.Your Switch is an investment, so it makes sense that you might want to enclose it in a full-time protective case. Mumba’s Dockable Case does just that – it offers full-time protection for your Switch and controllers, but also slips into the dock without needing to remove anything.The case is made with a shock-absorbent, rubberized material that’s easy to grip and will protect your console from bumps, scratches, and drops. Even so, it doesn’t interfere with any of the controls, so you’ll be able to leave it on almost all the time – even the Joy-Cons slip in and out effortlessly. And it’s available in black, blue, green, and red.If you take your Switch everywhere, battery life might be your most important concern. The Yobwin has an integrated 10,000 mAh battery, which can extend gameplay by as much as an additional eight hours. Alternately, it can charge your console 1.7 times. Thanks to a USB-C port, you can also use it as a standard power bank to charge other devices.This Nintendo Switch battery case also has some useful extras. The Joy-Con cover has slots on the inside to store extra games cartridges, and the back of the case has a kick stand with three different positions, so you can prop it up for play. And don’t worry about the plastic suffocating your Switch; in addition to a bevy of electrical protections (like over-current and over-voltage protection), the sculpted case doesn’t block air vents or interfere with the Switch’s heat dissipation.Bionik’s Power Commuter Travel Bag also has a beefy 10,000 mAh battery, but rather than charging in the case, this one is designed to plug in when you stop and play. The case includes an integrated charging cable and features USB-A and USB-C connectors that let you charge other devices as well.Inside, this case is spacious and has room for a slew of Switch accessories, as well as a respectable 18 game cartridges. You can wear it across your shoulder or strap it to other luggage, and it’s finished in a military-style black mesh.There is no shortage of cases for the Nintendo Switch, with dozens showing up on Amazon and a wealth of other options, including boutique-made cases on sites like Etsy. And there are different sorts of cases as well; you can choose from among travel cases, protective snap-on cases, charging cases, and more.If you need something to carry your console around in, a carrying case or travel case is where you want to look. There are a lot of decorative cases – none made the list in this article – that bear images of game characters or logos. That’s fine, but whatever you choose, make sure it can meet the minimum requirements of being a carrying case; it should be padded well enough to protect your investment from routine impacts.It should also have a way to protect the screen from scratches (usually with a flip-down cover or sleeve) and be able to hold as many game cartridges as you want to carry around. Likewise, consider what you need to carry. Perhaps all you need is the console itself, but if you’re traveling home to see the parents, you might need a case large enough to hold the dock and an HDMI cable.Some cases step up the game with an integrated battery. It’s probably not worth considering a charging case with less than about 10,000 mAh of power – that’ll power your Switch through just short of two complete charges. Bonus points if the battery charges quickly, and can also charge other devices in your inventory.Remember that these are cases you’ll need to cart around in the real world. What, exactly, do you want to be seen wearing or carrying? Some cases look a little goofy or childish, which is fine if you’re a child, and less so if you’re a grownup who takes a Switch to work for lunch break.\n\nDave Johnson has been writing about gaming and tech since the days of the Palm Pilot.

This page describes how to get the Bladed Staff and why you would want it in Final Fantasy VII Remake.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest draw, however, is its unique ability, Lustrous Shield. This is a perfect ability for Aerith, as it enables her to stay put on her Arcane Ward a bit easier.\n\nLoading\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Bladed Staff is very easy to miss, especially if you don't take care to Assess every enemy you come across. The only way to get the Bladed Staff is to steal it off the Chapter 11 - Haunted final boss, Eligor.\n\nYou'll encounter Eligor right after the main scenario \"Clear the Way.\" You'll see a bench and a vending machine, so take that as your cue to get ready. Of course, you need to equip the Steal Materia to someone in your party.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Get Steal Materia [ edit ] You must have unlocked Steal Materia no later than Chapter 9. To do this, you must have completed Chadley's Battle Intel Report 07 and purchased the Steal Materia from him. This report required you to exploit the weaknesses of 15 enemy types, which should have been easy to accomplish before Chapter 8.\n\nBecause the Steal action requires ATB, we equipped the Steal Materia to Tifa. Tifa's Speed (the stat that determines how fast ATB charges) is amazing, plus Tifa's unique ability (Triangle) builds ATB as well. So, she's able to dish out abilities fast and often. Tifa's Luck is also naturally pretty high, and Luck affects the success rate of Steal. Basically, you want a character with high Luck and Speed to maximize your chance of getting it and the attempts you have to do so.\n\nOnce the boss fight against Eligor begins, simply build ATB with Tifa and use Steal on it until you get it. One of us got the Bladed Staff on our second Steal attempt, but it can potentially take much longer.\n\nWhen you're successful, a notification will pop up like in the screenshot above. (Yes, we know that's Aerith in the picture - but we were Stealing with Tifa! )\n\nadvertisement\n\nThat's about all there is to getting the Bladed Staff, one of the most easily miss-able weapons in the game."}

He also shared the difficulties of running a startup right now that depends largely on small- and medium-size businesses, noting that even though Namely’s customers sign up for between one- and three-year-long contracts — they also pay an additional amount for a minimum number of employees — many of those customers are finding it difficult to fulfill those contracts at the moment.\n\nHe pointed to one client who has numerous yoga studios and who earlier this year employed 500 people but has laid off all but 15 of them in the shutdown. Said Dunivan, “We just had a stark, painful conversation and you could tell I was one of many people she was calling. [But] because I care about that relationship, I waived that minimum for some period of time so she can conserve cash.”\n\nWhich means less revenue for Namely.\n\nIt’s a situation that many startups find themselves in. According to Layoffs.fyi, site that’s trying to track industry layoffs as they happen, at least 356 startups have now laid off 34343 employees. That’s saying nothing of the many companies and small businesses like yoga studios that don’t register as tech startups. In fact, nearly four million people filed for unemployment benefits last week alone, bringing to more than 30 million the nation’s number of unemployment claims.\n\nWhile the deep cuts are understandable in the current context, they also represent one in a series of milestones at Namely that no startup wants to encounter. Though it was once among New York’s most promising businesses and accordingly raised at least $217 million from investors, including Matrix Partners, True Ventures, and Sequoia Capital, it has seen more than its share of transition at the top. In the most devastating development for the company until now, Namely’s board abruptly fired the company’s cofounder, Matt Straz, as its CEO in 2018.\n\nAccused of actions “inconsistent with that which is expected of Namely leadership,” as the company told employees at the time, Straz has gone on to launch an employee benefits startup called Bennie. But it cast a cloud over the company (which still isn’t talking about what happened).\n\nSoon after, the board member who led the investigation into Straz — longtime Silicon Valley executive Elisa Steele — was appointed as Namely’s permanent CEO, which at the time helped attract $60 million in new funding to the company led by GGV Capital.\n\nYet by last summer, she had also left as CEO, a decision that she made based on family commitments says one source, and owes partly to the relationship she had established with Dunivan, he said separately. Specifically, Dunivan said that in his previous role as the interim CEO of the human resources company ThinkHR, he was consulted by Steele on business and product strategy, and that “as sometimes happens, one thing led to the other and i joined” the company in her stead. (Steele remains on the company’s board.)\n\nCertainly, he inherited a business that no longer enjoys the sheen it once did.\n\nAs says one person with a stake in the business, “I don’t think anyone is giving up on Namely but it had a modest growth plan at the start of 2020 and that’s now been made uncertain because of [COVID-19]. I think the company is just trying to control what it can and to structure itself so it can operate more efficiently with a major drop-off in revenue.” Adds this person, “It’s like a clean sheet of paper.”\n\nIt’s an optimistic perspective and surely one that remaining employees will need to embrace, at least until the fourth quarter, which is when Dunivan estimates that businesses across the board may pick up again.\n\n“This is an extraordinarily difficult time, but we look at the world through a fairly conservative lens and we’re making certain assumptions about how new customers will buy, how existing customers will increase or decrease headcount, and how many businesses will be closed and never to come back,” said Dunivan when we spoke earlier.\n\n“It’s my believe that the recovery will start to show signs of life in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, and our current looks at it through that lens,” he added. “But in the meantime, employers will be paying fewer people.”\n\nFaced with dwindling options, Namely is now among them."}

Without the proper tools, that data will sit undisturbed, rendering it worthless.\n\nA number of companies have sprung up to help automakers manage and use data generated from connected cars. Israeli startup Otonomo is one such player that jumped on the scene in 2015 with a cloud-based software platform that captures and anonymizes vehicle data so it can then be used to create apps to provide services such as electric vehicle management, subscription-based fueling, parking, mapping, usage-based insurance and emergency service.\n\nThe startup announced this week it has raised $46 million to take its automotive data platform further. The capital was raised in a Series C funding round that included investments from SK Holdings, Avis Budget Group and Alliance Ventures. Existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners also participated. Otonomo has raised $82 million, to date.\n\nThe funds will be used to help Otonomo scale its business, improve its products and help it remain competitive, according to the company. Otonomo is also aiming to expand into new markets, particularly South Korea and Japan.\n\n“We now have the expanded resources needed to deliver on our vision of making car data as valuable as possible for the entire transportation ecosystem, while adhering to the strictest privacy and security standards,” Otonomo CEO and founder Ben Volkow said in a statement.\n\nOtonomo’s pitch focuses on creating opportunities to monetize connected car data while keeping it safe from the moment it is captured. Once the data is securely collected, the platform modifies it so companies can use it to develop apps and services for fleets, smart cities and individual customers. The platform also enables GDPR, CCPA and other privacy regulation-compliant solutions using both personal and aggregate data.\n\nToday, Otonomo’s platform takes in 2.6 billion data points a day from more than 20 million vehicles through partnerships with more than automakers, fleets and farm and construction manufacturers. Otonomo has more than 25 partnerships, a list that includes Daimler, BMW, Mitsubishi Motor Company and Avis Budget Group. The company said it’s preparing to bring on seven more customers.\n\nThat opportunity for Otonomo is growing based on forecasts, including one from SBD Automotive that predicts connected cars will account for more than 70% of cars sold in North American and European markets in 2020."}

We believed then, and still do, that alignment with founders was more important than covering our downside in investments that didn’t work as planned. Said differently, we wanted to enhance our upside through alignment, rather than maximizing our downside through terms.\n\nThe world has changed a lot since that time. While we are actively making investments, and still buying common stock, we know that many entrepreneurs may be trying to raise money now — and it is very hard.\n\nFred Destin wrote a great piece about the ugly terms that can creep into term sheets during difficult times. If you have a choice between a good term sheet and a bad one, of course, you’ll take the good one. But what if you have no choice? And how can you compare term sheets in the first place?\n\nTo this end, we developed the term-sheet grader, a simple way to compare different term sheets or help characterize whether a term sheet is good or evil.\n\nLet me first point out that none of this has anything to do with the valuation of the round (share price), the amount of capital, the likelihood of reaching a closing, the quality of the firm or the trust you have with the individual leading the investment, all absolutely critical pieces of the puzzle. Here, we are just looking at the terms and conditions, the legal structure of the investment.\n\nWe’ve listed nine key terms below — five that have to do with economics and four that relate to control and decision-making:\n\nEach key term can earn +1 for being friendly and -1 for being tough.\n\nThere are a few really friendly terms that have a score of +2 each.\n\nLikewise, there are a few really tough ones that earn a -2.\n\nThe best a term sheet could score is a +11, the worst is a -11.\n\nThe “Industry Standard” deal scores a 0.\n\nFWIW, the Pillar common stock standard deal earns a +8 (shown below)."}

A Valve employee posted an update to the company’s SteamVR forums, noting that “SteamVR has ended macOS support so our team can focus on Windows and Linux.”\n\nApple introduced “Metal for VR” back in June 2017 and highlighted a partnership with Valve. At the time, Valve was pushing VR as a platform and working with HTC on its Vive system; fast-forward to 2020 and Valve has its own high-end headset and has just released its highly-anticipated title “Half Life: Alyx.”\n\nThis impacts developers more so than actual gamers.\n\nAlmost no games supported Mac, and even Apple’s highest-end MacBook Pros failed to meet minimum specification requirements for Oculus or SteamVR. As the folks at Upload point out, Valve’s recent hardware survey showcases that just 4% of gamers on the platform use macOS to begin with, suggesting a pretty small sliver of actual gamers even fit in the Mac-owning VR user Venn diagram.\n\nGame developers building VR content on Mac likely enjoyed the ability to develop and test on a single machine. As Apple aggressively chases professionals with high-priced gear like the Mac Pro and iMac Pro, it’s not a great look when a major software platform decides you’re not worth the effort."}

Byju’s was valued at $5.75 billion in July last year, when it raised $150 million from Qatar Investment Authority and Owl Ventures.\n\nIf the deal goes through at this new term, Byju’s would become the second most valuable startup in India, joining budget lodging startup Oyo, which is also valued at $10 billion, and following financial services firm Paytm that raised $1 billion at $16 billion valuation late last year.\n\nThe talks haven’t finalized yet and terms could change, said one of the aforementioned people. This person, along with the other two, requested anonymity as the matter is private.\n\nSpokespeople of Byju’s and Prosus Ventures, the largest external investor in the startup, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Tiger Global did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nByju’s, which has raised more than $1.3 billion to date, has seen a sharp surge in both its free users and paying customers in recent weeks as it looks to court students who are stuck at home because of the nationwide lockdown New Delhi ordered in late March.\n\nThe startup told TechCrunch last month that traffic on its app and website was up 150% in March and it added six million students to the platform during the month.\n\nOther edtech startups, including Unacademy, which was recently backed by Facebook, and early-stage startups such as Sequoia Capital India-backed Classplus, and Chennai-based SKILL-LYNC, have also seen growth in recent weeks, they told TechCrunch last month.\n\nThrough its app, tutors on Byju’s help all school-going children understand complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake. The app also prepares students who are pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses.\n\nOver the years, Byju’s has invested in tweaking the English accents in its app and adapted to different education systems.

He joined the company when it was Colorado’s Medicine Man Technologies (MMT) in late 2019 and is revamping the organization, including changing its name to Schwazze and acquiring a handful of companies to create a healthier, vertically integrated cannabis company.\n\nThe cannabis market is experiencing a correction after a period of rapid expansion. Shops are feeling the pain, and public valuations are settling under IPO levels — and this was before a pandemic swept the world. Cannabis media outlet Leafly laid off 91 employees in late March, and Eaze, an early mover in on-demand pot delivery, is experiencing major trouble after raising serious cash and recently losing a top partner in Caliva. In several states, efforts are underway to prop up the cannabis market by asking for the federal government to allow these businesses to be eligible for federal financial relief.\n\nAccording to Dye, there are several things CEOs of cannabis companies of every size should work toward. His advice echoes what TechCrunch has heard in other verticals, as well: During the COVID-19 crisis, cannabis companies must hunker down and lean on strong teams to weather the storm. Once the skies start to clear, capital will be available to the survivors.\n\nOne, the cannabis market is looking for financially sustainable companies, Dye said.\n\n“This next reset in the cannabis industry will not only be aspirational, but it’s going to be coupled with a requirement for performance in terms of executing against a plan and driving profits — or driving it to create free cash flow to be reinvested in the business and product experiences.”"}

Specifically, the letter addressed Amazon’s apparent practice of diving into its trove of data on products and third-party sellers to come up with its own Amazon-branded competing products.\n\nAs the Journal notes, Amazon “has long asserted, including to Congress, that when it makes and sells its own products, it doesn’t use information it collects from the site’s individual third-party sellers—data those sellers view as proprietary.”\n\nIn documents and interviews with many former employees, the Journal found that Amazon does indeed consult that information when making decisions about pricing, product features and the kinds of products with the most potential to make the company money.\n\nIn the letter, the House Judiciary Committee accuses Bezos of making “misleading, and possibly criminally false or perjurious” statements to the committee when asked about the practice in the past.\n\n“It is vital to the Committee, as part of its critical work investigating and understanding competition issues in the digital market, that Amazon respond to these and other critical questions concerning competition issues in digital markets,” the committee wrote, adding that it would subpoena the tech CEO if necessary.\n\nWhile the coronavirus crisis has taken some of the heat off of tech’s mounting regulatory worries in the U.S., the committee’s actions make it clear that plenty of lawmakers are still interested in taking tech companies to task, even with so many aspects of life still up in the air."}

The smartphone market, once seemingly bulletproof, has suffered. The list of factors is long, and I’ve written about them ad nauseam here, but the CliffsNotes version is: costs are too high, innovation is too incremental and most people already own a device that will be plenty good for the next few years.\n\nBut 2020 was going to be different. Smartphone makers were set to finally give consumers a reason to upgrade in the form of 5G. The first handsets appeared in earnest last year, but between a much wider carrier roll out, lower-cost 5G radios from Qualcomm and the arrival of a 5G iPhone, this was going to be the year the next-gen wireless technology helped reverse the smartphone slide.\n\nAnd then COVID-19 disrupted everything. For many of us, life is on hold — and will likely continue to be for months. I’m writing this from my home in Queens, N.Y., the hardest-hit county in the hardest-hit country in the world. It still feels strange to type that, even though it’s been a reality for a month and half now.\n\nPurchasing a smartphone is most likely the last thing on anyone’s mind during what is shaping up to be the worst global pandemic since the 1918 flu pandemic. With a number of key manufacturers reporting quarterly earnings this week, the numbers are starting to bear out this disconnect. Earlier this week, both Samsung and LG reported weak mobile numbers. Yesterday, Apple reported revenue of $28.96 billion, down from $31.1 billion the same time last year.\n\nMore troubling, all three companies appeared to be united in suggesting that the worst might be yet to come. Samsung suggested that both mobile and TV demand would “decline significantly” in the following quarter. LG used virtually the same exact wording, stating that, “market demand is expected to decline significantly YoY due to COVID-19 pandemic.” For its part, Apple simply didn’t issue guidance for the next quarter, a surefire indication of uncertainty in these uncertain times — to borrow a phrase from every commercial airing currently."}

Congress never appropriated the $120 million requested to complete ER One, and the project was reduced to 10 new emergency rooms and a 2,500-square-foot warehouse stocked with supplies for a mass-casualty event.\n\nThe boom-and-bust cycle of federal spending has characterized the U.S. government’s response to national health emergencies over the past two decades.\n\nOf the more than $118 billion the federal government invested from 2001 through 2017 in protecting the nation from health threats, less than $6 billion — including funds designated for ER One — went to assisting the nation’s network of more than 6,000 hospitals, records show. Federal funding for hospital preparedness peaked at $515 million in 2004 and has plummeted since then, to $276 million this year.\n\nHospital preparedness funding Annual funding for the Hospital Preparedness Program peaked in 2004.

Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said. “I can only hope we now focus on how this pandemic changes the way we look at preparing for the unthinkable.”\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed the lives of more than 64,000 people and sickened at least 9,000 health-care workers in the United States, has again brought into sharp relief the vulnerabilities at hospitals across the nation. While many health-care officials say they are better prepared for major emergencies now than before the 2001 terrorist attacks, those efforts have been undermined by steady funding cuts, according to records and interviews with 50 health officials.\n\n[Mapping the spread of coronavirus across the U.S.]\n\nMost hospitals — nonprofit, public and for-profit — operate on thin financial margins and have little to no budget for contingency preparations. A 2018 report by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General found that nearly all of the roughly 400 hospital administrators surveyed said they had too many obligations to prepare for emerging infectious diseases in the absence of a current threat.\n\n“Why is it that we don’t expect firefighters to fight fires with a garden hose or police officers to enter dangerous situations without their guns?” asked Nina Pham, an intensive care unit nurse who contracted Ebola in 2014 after caring for an infected patient in Dallas and sued the hospital for failing to provide proper training or gear. “Yet, now, I see the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is recommending that in the absence of adequate safety equipment, nurses and doctors use bandannas and reuse their masks.”\n\nEven after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when dozens of people died in sweltering hospitals with no electricity or water, federal grants to prepare hospitals declined. During three major infectious-disease outbreaks — the avian flu in 2006, the swine flu in 2009 and Ebola in 2014 — Congress passed bills that designated a modest $425 million to fix the most glaring preparedness problems in the health-care system.\n\nHospital workers help a coronavirus patient and asylum-seeker from Guatemala take her first steps after being removed from a ventilator at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut on April 24, 2020. Access to the equipment had been a concern at hospitals for years before the current crisis. (John Moore/Getty Images)\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that authorizes the grants, did not answer questions about the funding cuts since 2004, but in February wrote a column on the Fox News website defending how Congress had prepared the country for the pandemic.\n\n“No matter the outbreak or threat, Congress and the federal government have been vigilant in identifying gaps in its readiness efforts and improving its response capabilities,” Alexander wrote in the piece, co-authored by Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.).\n\n[Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.]\n\nTommy G. Thompson, a Republican who was head of HHS on 9/11, said the overall lack of federal funding has left hospitals ill-prepared for national health emergencies.\n\n“In America, we deal with the problem when it comes up, bingo!” he said. “We’re very shortsighted.”\n\nThe consequences of this approach are playing out today in New Jersey, where hospitals are overwhelmed with coronavirus patients and the state has had the second-highest number of deaths from covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, in the nation. From 2010 to 2018, federal funding to help New Jersey hospitals prepare for health emergencies fell from $11 million to $5.5 million, leading to smaller stockpiles of emergency supplies and less training to prepare for a surge of patients.\n\n“We’re seeing very vividly, in real time, the harsh impact when we don’t prioritize emergency preparedness and response funding for health care,” said Cathy Bennett, president of the New Jersey Hospital Association.\n\n‘Grossly inadequate’ from the start\n\nA helicopter from Washington Hospital Center's emergency-response team flies over the Pentagon in Washington on Sept. 11, 2001, as smoke billows after al-Qaeda terrorists crashed American Airlines Flight 77 into the building. (Heesoon Yim/ AP)\n\nAfter al-Qaeda’s attack in 2001, President George W. Bush and his administration were convinced that terrorists would strike again with biological and chemical agents or a small radiological device.\n\nThat fear drove Congress to appropriate $2.9 billion in funding in 2002 to HHS for bioterrorism preparedness, much of it for the research and development of vaccines and antidotes against weapons of mass destruction. Officials in some states used the money to set up laboratories, stockpile antibiotics and purchase chemical sniffers to detect traces of bioagents in the air.\n\nBut hospitals — the nation’s front line defense to biological attacks — were somewhat of an afterthought. Congress gave them $135 million, to be administered by HHS through a new Hospital Preparedness Program grant. Hospitals may receive funding from other federal agencies, but for nearly two decades the grant program has been the only federal source of funds dedicated to preparing the nation’s health-care network for major emergencies.\n\nThe grants, however, were insufficient from the start.\n\nAcross the country, hospitals required more than $11 billion to be prepared for the aftermath of an attack with a weapon of mass destruction, according to a 2003 estimate by the American Hospital Association.\n\nThe money was needed for equipment, including personal protective gear, along with decontamination facilities, extra hospital beds, pharmaceutical supplies and additional training.\n\nBut the $11 billion proposal was a non-starter in Congress, according to Jerome Hauer, who served from 2002 to 2004 as the HHS acting assistant secretary of the newly created Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness, which oversaw the grants.\n\n“We knew right up front that the amount that was being spent on hospitals was grossly inadequate,” Hauer said.\n\nA volunteer acting as a casualty during a \"Red Alert\" disaster preparedness drill is scrubbed down at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn on Aug. 14, 2002. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nIn July 2004, Susan Waltman, general counsel of the Greater New York Hospital Association, testified before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and pressed lawmakers to set aside more money for hospitals.\n\nHospitals in New York City, which had grappled directly with 9/11, each spent about $5.5 million on average for emergency preparedness in 2002 and 2003, she said. The federal government had only contributed about $75,000 to each.\n\n“Our hospitals take on these additional responsibilities for the benefit of the country at large, and they in turn deserve to be supported in their efforts,” Waltman testified.\n\nCongress increased funding for hospital preparedness to $515 million annually. That lasted two years.\n\nLessons from Hurricane Katrina\n\nPatients and staff of Charity Hospital in New Orleans are evacuated by airboat on Sept. 2, 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.

The hospital had been flooded during Hurricane Katrina. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nIn 2005, Katrina pummeled Louisiana and exposed the shortcomings of the nation’s efforts to strengthen emergency defenses after 9/11.\n\nKatrina was one of the deadliest and costliest hurricanes in U.S. history, killing more than 1,200 people and flooding large parts of New Orleans. The city’s largest hospital at the time, Charity, lost power for days and ran short of food and water.\n\nAs recovery efforts slogged away and Charity remained shuttered, Burr convened a hearing in New Orleans in July 2006 with public health officials and hospital leaders to discuss lessons learned.\n\n“Traditionally in public health disasters we think about things like having access to biologicals and things, antidotes for biological weapons,” testified Fred Cerise, secretary of Louisiana’s Department of Health and Hospitals. “The stockpile we needed was the stockpile of medicines for blood pressure and diabetes and heart disease.”\n\nCongress seemed to listen.\n\nLater that summer, Burr and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), introduced the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act. The legislation, which was approved in December 2006 with bipartisan support, created a new HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness Response (ASPR) that oversaw the nation’s medical and public health preparedness and response efforts.\n\nThe new office would administer grants through states to hospitals, requiring them to include planning for pandemic flu, natural disasters and regional coordination.\n\nCongress, however, neglected to provide additional funding. Instead, HHS took $43 million from the existing hospital grant budget to set up a pilot program for hospitals to partner with state agencies and local health-care institutions on emergency preparedness. But applicants had two weeks to submit proposals for spending.\n\nBecause of the tight deadline, some projects were undeveloped, and others overambitious, according to a report by the Center for Biosecurity at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.\n\nUnder the program, Rhode Island Hospital secured $5 million to partner with other hospitals and organizations around the state. They used the money to design an emergency communications system but didn’t have enough funding to launch it at all hospitals. Plans for a patient tracking system fell apart and there was no money to sustain the project, according to the report.\n\n“I don’t think the government wanted this responsibility,” said Eric Toner, a co-author of the report who now works as a senior researcher at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “They wanted hospitals to pay for their own preparedness like they did prior to 2001.”\n\nBurr declined to comment.\n\nMeg Femino, senior director of emergency management at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said her hospital received about $75,000 in federal preparedness funding and stretched the money over three years.\n\nFrom 2006 through 2009, she stockpiled enough antibiotics to treat every employee and three of their family members in case of a terrorist attack or infectious-disease outbreak. To prepare for a natural disaster like Katrina, Beth Israel Deaconess crafted a sweeping evacuation plan, bought medical sleds to move patients and drilled for evacuating across the medical center.\n\n“Every time we saw something new came up, we would put that on our cache of things that we would have to work on,” Femino said.\n\nPandemic preparation\n\nNurses and doctors check the temperatures of travelers entering Thailand from Hong Kong at Bangkok International Airport on April 22, 2003 at the height of the SARS epidemic. (Paula Bronstein/Getty Images)\n\nBy the mid-2000s, Bush had turned his attention to a new enemy: a worldwide pandemic.\n\nMuch of the world was already familiar with SARS, or sudden acute respiratory syndrome. The virus tore through Asia starting in 2002 and made its way the following year to Toronto, where many health-care workers were infected with the deadly respiratory illness.\n\nThe SARS virus largely spared the United States. But concern grew as the avian flu, or H5N1, resurfaced in Asia and then spread in 2005 to Europe and the Middle East.\n\nAnthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned Congress about the threat when he testified in the summer of 2005.\n\n“Although we cannot be certain exactly when the next influenza pandemic will occur,” Fauci said, “we can be virtually certain that one will occur and that the resulting morbidity, mortality and economic disruption would present extraordinary challenges to public health authorities around the world.”\n\nMonths later, Bush pressed Congress to funnel billions of dollars toward preparing the country for a flu pandemic.\n\nLawmakers approved spending $6.1 billion by June 2006 — but only $75 million for the hospital preparedness program. The money primarily went toward developing flu vaccines and stockpiling antivirals.\n\nHospitals again came under pressure when a novel strain of influenza called H1N1, or the swine flu, surfaced in 2009 in Mexico and spread to the United States. The virus sickened about 60 million Americans and killed nearly 12,000.\n\nIn western Michigan, Jerry Evans, the medical director for a regional health-care coalition that includes more than 25 hospitals near Grand Rapids, said that as swine flu patients filled area hospitals, he worried about running out of ventilators.\n\nTo fight the pandemic, Congress gave HHS about $7.6 billion in 2009, most of it going to vaccine production and to state and local governments for a mass vaccination campaign. Only $90 million went to the hospital preparedness program.\n\nEvans’s coalition received $1.8 million, which he said was used to purchase 70 extra ventilators and 300 portable beds that could be used in gyms or auditoriums if hospitals were overwhelmed.\n\n‘We can’t do it on our own’\n\nA hospital employee exits Washington Hospital Center's “ready room” for potential swine flu patients on April 30, 2009. (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe H1N1 pandemic was severe but it didn’t hit the United States as hard as some experts had feared. And again, Congress lost interest in investing in the nation’s health-care system.\n\nThat upended hospital training, supplies and jobs for some people, including Mike Cahoon, who was hired in 2004 to coordinate emergency preparedness at 10 hospitals in northern New York.\n\nCahoon, based at the 300-bed Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital in Plattsburgh, oversaw a regional resource center for rural hospitals and conducted training to improve surge capacity after Katrina. With an annual budget of $500,000 in the early years, Cahoon built stockpiles of medicine, respirator masks and decontamination equipment for area hospitals. He secured four extra ventilators from the state in 2008 following the avian flu outbreak.\n\nBut in 2012, Congress slashed the hospital preparedness program and funding shifted to health-care coalitions that included public-health officials, emergency-management services, long-term care facilities and others. This approach attempted to stretch dwindling dollars and improve regional coordination across the health-care system.\n\n[An analysis of U.S. hospital data shows why health officials are seeking more resources to treat coronavirus patients]\n\nIn 2014, New York cut off money to four of its eight regional resource centers, including Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital. Across the country, federal grants awarded through the hospital preparedness program plunged 40 percent, from $420 million to $255 million between 2010 and 2014, under President Barack Obama.\n\nWhen Cahoon couldn’t afford the annual ventilator maintenance — about $2,500 for each unit — he had them wrapped in plastic and placed in storage along with expiring respirator masks and other equipment.\n\n“Does it hurt us out in the field now or with boots on the ground? Yes it does,” said Cahoon, who had to take on various jobs at the hospital after federal funding dried up. “We can't do it on our own. We need federal help.”\n\nNicole Lurie, who served as assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS from 2009 through January 2017, said the agency always had to fight for more money for the hospital grant program.\n\n“There was the sense in Congress that hospitals had bought their stuff, and so more money was not needed,” Lurie said. “They didn’t seem to realize that the budget needs are also about people and training.”\n\nFormer congressman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), who sponsored federal funding to prepare for national emergencies, said he found it hard to drum up interest in hospitals from other lawmakers absent a crisis.\n\n“No one wants to pay for the new firetruck until the damn alarm goes off. Right? Right, then you go, ‘Oh, my God, we should have a firetruck that’s up to date,’ ” Rogers said. “No one wants to pay for it. And so the more of these things drifted away from the public eye, the easier it was to say, ‘Well, I’d rather spend that money over here somewhere.’\n\n“And that’s exactly what happened.”\n\nThe lack of attention has challenged the hospital grant program nationwide.\n\nIn the District, there appeared to be little to no monitoring of emergency equipment or training with it for long stretches of time, according to Don Donahue, who was hired to provide support for the city’s warehouse on V Street in Northeast Washington. One of his first tasks was to take inventory of the supplies that were purchased with a mix of hospital preparedness grants and other local and federal funds.\n\nStacks of boxes containing face masks sit in a District warehouse on V Street NE in August 2010. (Don Donahue)\n\nIn 2010, Donahue found a $3 million urban search-and-rescue system resting on its original five-year-old shipping pallets. In a storage area on the former D.C. General Hospital campus, he located another $1 million of neglected response equipment, including a deployable shelter, generator and first-aid station. Donahue later discovered a decontamination tent destroyed by dry rot. Five scooters and 13 generators were missing, and Donahue’s team never figured out where they went.\n\nDonahue, a retired deputy surgeon and medical adviser to the chief of Army Reserve, documented his findings, taking photographs and reporting them to city councilors by email.\n\n“These resources have been totally ignored for years,” Donahue emailed in March 2014. “Millions of dollars of equipment is degrading in place.”\n\nWhen Donahue’s contract expired in 2015, more than 4 million masks, including surgical and N95 masks, that had expired or were about to expire were stacked on top of one another in the original cardboard boxes, according to inventory records.\n\nThe emergency equipment in the V Street NE warehouse was relocated in 2019 and there were “significant improvements,” according to a D.C. Department of Health spokeswoman. She acknowledged that some personal protective equipment has been stored past their expiration date, and is distributed with approval by the federal government.\n\nThe Ebola crisis\n\nDominic Kollie, an Ebola survivor, suits up to go inside an Ebola ward as other staff members move in ahead in Monrovia, Liberia, on Nov. 34, 2014.

(Michel du Cille/The Washington Post)\n\nBy the time Ebola surfaced in the United States in 2014, the nation had a decade of lessons learned from other health catastrophes. But the highly contagious, fatal disease quickly showed how vulnerable hospitals remained.\n\nIn July 2014, the CDC issued a travel warning advising people to avoid the heart of the outbreak in West Africa. The next month, the CDC boldly stated that it “is confident that U.S. hospitals are capable of safely managing a patient with Ebola when carefully following CDC’s infection control recommendations.”\n\nWeeks later, 41-year-old Thomas Eric Duncan showed up at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, after having recently traveled to Liberia, with abdominal pain and a fever that spiked to 103 degrees. No one suspected he might be infected with Ebola.\n\nInstead, staff discharged him with a diagnosis of sinusitis. He came back several days later and was admitted with a severe fever, diarrhea and vomiting.\n\nPham, the intensive-care nurse who later filed a lawsuit against the hospital, alleged administrators never trained her or her colleagues about Ebola and failed to provide appropriate personal protective equipment or guidance on how to use the gear.\n\nTexas Health Presybterian Hospital nurse Nina Pham is helped out of the back of an ambulance on the runway at Love Field airport in Dallas on Oct. 16, 2014. She contracted Ebola as part of a team of health-care workers who had treated Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who had died of the virus eight days earlier. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nBy the time Duncan died on Oct. 8, 2014, dozens of hospital employees had cared for him and two staff members — Pham and another nurse — contracted the disease. Within days, Pham went from being a healthy 26-year-old to having end-of-life discussions with doctors and receiving her last rites. She eventually recovered and the suit against Texas Health Resources, the company that owned the hospital, was settled with undisclosed terms.\n\nThe hospital did not respond to questions from The Washington Post, including whether it had received funding through the hospital preparedness program.\n\nAn independent report commissioned by the hospital in 2015 found the Dallas facility was “not prepared to diagnose and manage a patient who came to their facility without a preexisting diagnosis of Ebola” and recommended increasing preparedness drills and training for Ebola and other emerging infectious diseases.\n\nTwo months after Duncan died, Congress appropriated about $5.4 billion to respond to the Ebola outbreak, most of which was directed overseas to help contain the crisis.\n\n“Ebola was a big wake-up call to say we need to really invest,” said Saskia Popescu, a senior infection prevention epidemiologist, who has published studies on the response to Ebola and covid-19.\n\nPublic health threat funding Federal spending to ready hospitals for health emergencies is a fraction of what has been spent on overall preparedness for bioterrorism, pandemics and other health hazards.

Total health hazard preparedness funding $7.9B $8B $5 BILLION Hospital Preparedness Program $255M $420M 0 2010 2017\n\nBut of the billions appropriated, only about $260 million was designated for hospital preparedness grants. Popescu said most of that went to a small number of hospitals that could assess and treat Ebola patients.\n\nThe money to fight Ebola that reached front-line hospitals didn’t go very far. Goodall-Witcher Healthcare, located southwest of Dallas, received eight surgical masks, 16 bioprotective suits, 32 chemo gowns and other small items. Total value: $2,600.\n\nPham, speaking publicly for the first time in five years, said she is “frustrated and brokenhearted watching as nurses, doctors and other front-line health care workers endure the lack of basic lifesaving equipment,” during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nShe is now a clinical consultant for a Dallas insurance firm and is also working with nurses and medical directors to monitor the outbreak and respond to questions.\n\n“It takes me back to my own fear and anxiety when I had to care for just one Ebola patient,” Pham said.\n\nAnthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, puts his arm around Nina Pham after a news briefing at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda on Oct. 24, 2014. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nEroded funds\n\nIn recent years, HHS funds have eroded so much that some hospital officials said they have stopped applying for the money. Others have had to pool resources to make the grants worth the effort.\n\nIn 2018, UCSF Health, in San Francisco, received $5,500 from HHS and used it to train workers on how to deal with a surge of patients after an active shooting, said Marjorie Smallwood, UCSF Health’s director of emergency management.\n\n“To be honest, it was quite laughable,” Smallwood said of the funding amount.\n\nLast year, the county and its 11 hospitals decided to combine their individual grants.\n\nIn 2018, the American Hospital Association pleaded with lawmakers to restore funding to the HHS program to the post-9/11 era levels of $515 million. Instead, Congress bumped the appropriation from $255 million to $265 million.\n\nIn February, as the coronavirus spread worldwide, the Trump administration proposed slicing another $18 million from the hospital preparedness program. Weeks later, Congress approved another $100 million for the program.\n\nIn the meantime, hospital officials across the country scrambled to patch together resources.\n\n[Inside America’s mask crunch: A slow government reaction and an industry wary of liability]\n\nIn northern New York, Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital pulled the aging ventilators from storage and sent them out for maintenance. The hospital also distributed to staff a stash of the N95 and surgical masks, some beyond their expiration date.\n\nIn western Michigan, Evans, the regional medical director, passed out the ventilators and recovery cots purchased after the H1N1 crisis, hoping that they will suffice.\n\n“Disaster preparedness is one of those things where people don’t care, or they lose interest until it happens,” Evans said. “Then they all want to know, 'Why weren’t we prepared?’ ”\n\nThe remnants of ER One\n\nA mannequin in a protective suit is seen in the “ready room” at Washington Hospital Center on April 30, 2009, during the swine flu outbreak.

The hospital also bought two dozen ventilators and constructed the 2,500-square-foot “ready room” with cots, oxygen supplies, self-help carts and other equipment. Hospital staff described it as essentially a storage room for emergency equipment and a place to conduct training.\n\nMedStar Washington Hospital Center's “Bridge to ER One” includes an area with the 10 emergency rooms built with antimicrobial wall material and self-contained air systems. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nSince the pandemic began, the hospital has used the 10 rooms to hold and test patients suspected to have covid-19.\n\nMichael Pietrzak, the lead design consultant for ER One, said when the coronavirus struck, he thought immediately of the yellowed copy of his 1,000-page report in storage and what he says was a lost opportunity.\n\n“It was very emotional,” Pietrzak said. “All I can do is sit here. If I wave the flag from here, people will just say, ‘Who the hell is he?’ ”\n\nAaron C. Davis, Andrew Ba Tran and Lena H. Sun contributed to this report.

Some died in the home while others died in the hospital.\n\nAs recently as Thursday, a state database of nursing home fatalities listed just 13 deaths at Isabella. The nursing home confirmed the additional deaths after NY1 reported that many residents who died had not been counted and that the facility was using refrigerator trailers to store some of the bodies.\n\nIsabella officials said the nursing home had followed state and federal guidelines for infection control but could not sufficiently test residents and workers as the virus spread through the 705-bed facility.\n\n“Unfortunately, Isabella, like all other nursing homes in New York City, initially had limited access to widespread and consistent in-house testing to quickly diagnose our residents and staff,” read a statement from the nursing home. “Sadly, while we have always had daily health screenings of staff, this hampered our ability to identify those who were infected and asymptomatic, despite our efforts to swiftly separate anyone who presented symptoms.”\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said he had visited the home and that the city had delivered “substantial amounts” of personal protective equipment to the site over the past month, including 12,000 protective masks.\n\n“This is a staggering toll we’re hearing about now, and I’m shocked” de Blasio said. “This is to me an inestimable loss.

Measuring roughly 18 inches by 24 inches, the printed map encapsulates an antipodal, 103,483-square-mile country that required 20 hours of air travel for me to get there. Yes, it’s a map of New Zealand.\n\nThe time I spent there a few months ago wasn’t long enough. I had never before been and didn’t want to leave, and thus hoped to return one day. That day, much sooner than I ever hoped, suddenly feels like now — thanks to the map. Whether in plotting a future trip or reliving past travels, maps provide serendipitous, safe escape from the coronavirus lurking outside.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“Ready for an exciting journey?” asks the prominent typeface on the road map’s frontispiece. Published by Mode Car & Camper Rentals, the map both led and followed me everywhere — from the rental car’s glove compartment into my computer bag, then across the Pacific to where it now sits among domestic clutter.\n\nTo unfold the accordion-like panels is to be granted the revelatory overview of New Zealand’s North Island on one side and the South Island on the other. Major urban centers, such as Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, have their very own maps placed in insets where the Pacific Ocean and Tasman Sea would normally, realistically lie.\n\nThe paper is beginning to tear at some of the folds, proof of its frequent use, especially when my hands were still damp from splashing in the breakers off Raglan or capsizing while canoeing on the Whanganui River. And that time I spilled a “long black” in the car, there’s evidence of that, too, in the coffee stains fouling the map’s Bay of Plenty. But paper, like Mother Nature herself, is more forgiving than a laptop keyboard or smartphone, which would have been ruined forever by such a spill.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI pick up the road map, unfold it, spread it across the desktop like a tablecloth. Its careful typography and precise lines cover up the disorder underneath of random stacks of disorganized sheets of unrelated papers. It also seems to impose temporary order on the outside world, now turned upside down by an unseen virus: If something can be mapped, it can be controlled.\n\nThe semigloss, heavyweight paper that the map is printed on feels good to the touch, more down-to-earth than satellite-based GPS. The road map’s very physicality, unlike fleeting images on MapQuest or Google Maps, seems warmly reassuring in this time of physical distancing when we can’t touch others.\n\nSure, I admit to following — passively, unthinkingly, unquestioningly — the commanding voice on my smartphone when, for instance, trying to forge the quickest path from Point A (Auckland) to Point B (nearby Beachlands). But to be an active participant in the journey — to be an aware traveler and truly understand where I was going — I needed the context of the printed road map.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPlus, GPS is just too easy, too detailed, leaving little to the imagination. Printed maps, on the other hand, are full of suggestive and mysterious blank spaces, waiting to be filled in by your creativity and personal experiences. In contrast, my smartphone’s Google app called Timeline leaves nothing to the imagination and imposes its own artificial-intelligence-generated memories over my own.\n\nFor my last pre-pandemic travels — to Quebec in search of enough snow to cross-country ski — Google Timeline recalls with perfect precision which restaurants I visited, what time I arrived at my Airbnb, its exact address, ad infinitum. But it’s all too much detailed information, ignoring the old marketing axiom regarding the powerful emotional mix of reminiscences and anticipation: to sell the sizzle and not the steak. So, instead, I prefer to unfold my well-used street map of Old Quebec City, where my mind’s eye can see in reawakened soft focus the blizzardlike conditions blurring the groomed trails on the Plains of Abraham. And more: I can savor again the bottle of wine I opened apres-ski in the warm glow of a rustic fireplace, away from Google’s prying, all-seeing eye.\n\n“The real voyage of discovery consists, not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.” That celebrated quote from Marcel Proust’s “Remembrance of Things Past” speaks to the magic of maps. Among my favorites in seeing the world anew are topographical maps, available from the U.S. Geological Survey. They are matchless in coming to understand your travels’ lay of the land — especially when planning or reflecting upon outdoor activities. The maps’ contour lines let you, the hiker, know how steep and strenuous a trek may be or, as a white-water canoeist and kayaker, how rapid a river’s descent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince cartography’s earliest beginnings, huge blank spaces — terra incognita and mare incognitum — seduced adventurous travelers. Like theater, maps entertained, as evidenced by the title of the first attempt at a world atlas (1570) — Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (Theatre of the Orb of the World). Included in this atlas was the forerunner of my New Zealand road map, the hypothesized lands of the southern hemisphere Terra Australis Incognita (Unknown Land of the South).\n\nEven earlier world maps, in the Middle Ages, known as the Mappa Mundi, make the point that maps are always mirrors that reflect the zeitgeist — and thus are portals to the past. Medieval mapmakers were less interested in producing accurate navigational guides than in making the world conform to the harmonious order of God’s creation. Symmetry and perfect spheres took precedence over the irregularity of mountains and twisting paths of rivers.\n\n“Dissected maps” were some of the earliest jigsaw puzzles, in the 1700s, making geography fun for children. Originally cut from oak or mahogany, today’s cardboard versions are still popular, especially with adults keeping their minds active while stuck indoors. The 1,000-piece jigsaw of a 17th-century world map by Henricus Hondius, for instance, recently kept my self-isolated neighbors busy for days. They then swapped for other jigsaws with this understanding: “Disinfect and leave yours on your porch, and I will take yours and disinfect and leave mine.”\n\nYears ago I started collecting antique maps, especially ones of my native Virginia. Though now matted, framed, under glass and hanging motionless on a wall inside a house, they’re a traveler’s delight — transporting you not only over miles and miles but centuries as well. To linger over Captain John Smith’s 1607-1608 map of the Chesapeake, for instance, is to put you in his boat as he sailed up the Potomac looking for a waterway to the Western Ocean, as if seeing the places he records for the first time. His names for now-familiar places endure.\n\nNaming and (through revisionist history) renaming places illustrate the power of mapmakers. Their handiwork might be what we today call branding, for the story of a place can usually be found in its name. And if you could name a place, you controlled it. So it was that explorer Smith memorialized the land he mapped as “Virginia” after the virgin Queen Elizabeth, though he also recorded for posterity over a hundred Native American place names still in use today.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere’s even a name for the study of place names: toponymy. And so while gazing at my New Zealand road map, can it be said that I’m now engaged in a toponomastic search? Or call it mental peregrination, as I find myself hiking again up the rocky path of a small, spherical mountain rising where the Tauranga harbor meets the sea. Oddly out of place, this lone mountain is an extinct volcano called Mauao. What’s in a name?\n\nThe origins lie in a Maori tale of unrequited love. This small — at the time nameless — mountain deeply desired a neighboring, beautifully wooded hill. But her heart had already been taken by a higher, more prestigious mountain. So, sadly, the nameless mountain decided to drown itself in the ocean. His friends, the forest fairy people, who came out only at night, fastened him with lots of ropes to pull him to his death. They pulled all night and so created the valley seen today near Tauranga. But before they could get to the ocean, the sun rose — forcing the fairy people to retreat into the forest’s dark depths. Thus the mountain now stands where it does today, just touching the ocean, no longer nameless but called Mauao — meaning “caught by dawn.”\n\nThree-dimensional space may be the subject matter of maps, but time is ultimately what they’re all about. The time of history and geological prehistory, of course, but also your own time as a traveler, plotting ahead or endlessly revisiting. Even beyond the past and future, each map contains an alternative universe of endless contingency and infinite possibility, of roads not taken and unvisited places. What if?\n\nAD\n\nAD"}

But for the purposes of this guide, we’ll be focusing on those that are easy to set up and fun. The games below are ordered from least to most complex, with the last few requiring a bit more planning, resources and/or ingenuity, like screensharing or broadcasting video of a table-top game.\n\nHeads Up!\n\nA quick trivia-guessing game with a slew of categories.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat you need to play: Zoom and phones or tablets with the game. (2-∞ players)\n\nHeads Up! is a fast-paced game of charades in which each player has to guess a person, place or thing with help from the audience.\n\nTo play remotely, everyone needs to download the Heads Up! app on their phone. Players then select a deck of cards from a certain category, like movies, celebrities or brand names. At the start of every round, one person holds a phone to their forehead that displays the answer, showing the audience the answer, but leaving the phone-holder in the dark. Zoom allows users to hide their own reflected video display. Otherwise, you’ll be able to see the answer written right above your forehead.\n\nAD\n\nYou can play Heads Up! on teams or individually. The fun comes from thinking of witty hints to help the phone-holder say the correct name. When they guess correctly, they flip the phone down and score points. The goal is to correctly guess as many terms as possible in one minute.\n\nAD\n\nA warning from experience: it can get a bit unwieldy trying to hold an iPad on your forehead without flipping it onto the living room carpet. The app is free, but if you’re having fun, you can download more decks with other categories such as Star Wars, Seinfeld or trivia from past decades.\n\nBattleship\n\n(No, not this Battleship)\n\nWhat you need to play: Any video call app and two boards of Battleship; or paper and a writing utensil. (2 players)\n\nAD\n\nThe objective of Battleship is to find and sink all the vessels on your opponent’s board before they destroy yours. The catch is, neither of you know where the other has placed their battleships. It’s a guessing game with a bit of strategy in the later rounds.\n\nBattleship is for two players, and both will need a version of the game. If you’re feeling crafty, all you need is a ruler, some paper and some markers. The “battle stations” in the game are laid out on grids, and at the start of each game, players place their five ships in various places on the grid. Every round, the two players guess where their opponents boats may be — like “Go Fish” but with imaginary ships and torpedoes.\n\nAD\n\nThe first player to sink all their enemy’s ships wins. All around, it’s a pretty simple war game.\n\nAD\n\nOutburst\n\nFamily Feud, but it’s on Zoom instead of ABC.\n\nWhat you need to play: Any video call app and at least one copy of the game.\n\nWe asked people on Twitter to share what games they’re playing remotely and found Outburst, a timed party game from Hasbro that requires you to quickly name the top ten terms in a particular category, such as “chores parents ask their kids to do.” There’s a lot of shouting in this game, so you’ll want to take your Zoom off mute.\n\nThe game splits players into two teams who switch places every round between judging and guessing the answers. The more terms you correctly name, the more points for your team.\n\nIt’s a simple game and if you have one person playing the role of Steve Harvey for the entire time, you only need to buy one set of the game to play.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQuiplash\n\nFor the people who love Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity.\n\nWhat you need to play: A video conferencing app, like Zoom, where you can share screens and a version of Quiplash using Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Steam, PlayStation 4 or Xbox One (and more).\n\nQuiplash is a “Mad Libs” party game where players respond to prompts with the wittiest answers they can come up with. The entire group then votes on the best responses and players receive points for winning each round out of three.\n\nUp to eight players can play the fill-in-the-blank game. Like Apples to Apples, the game requires you play to your audience, but there’s no limit or guidance on what direction you can take a prompt. When playing with friends, feel free to reference or use an inside joke that only your group of friends would understand.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQuiplash is a title from Jackbox Games, a developer that publishes party games for groups to play together. The game is built to be played with all participants watching one screen (typically a TV).\n\nTo play Quiplash remotely, the quickest solution will be to buy the game on Steam and play it from your computer to then share on Zoom, Google Hangouts, Twitch, Discord or any service that lets you communicate and share your screen.\n\nIf you’re playing Quiplash on the PlayStation or Xbox, screensharing gets a bit more complicated. You’ll need to stream your gameplay from your television to Twitch or YouTube and have everyone tune in to the stream while on FaceTime or another video-conferencing app.\n\nDrawful 2\n\nLike Pictionary, a game for those who are more artistically-inclined.\n\nAD\n\nWhat you need to play: A video conferencing app, like Zoom, where you can share screens and a version of Drawful2 using Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Steam, PlayStation 4 or Xbox One (and more).\n\nAD\n\nDrawful 2 challenges players to use their fingers and some imagination to create art. The game is from the company behind Quiplash, and follows a similar format: Players must draw a given prompt and then guess what each piece of art is supposed to represent. Players can use their phones, tablets or computers to sketch out responses to the prompts, such as “tree surgeon” and “deadly hula hoop.”\n\nDrawful 2 and Quiplash have the same complication — if you’re playing on a gaming console, like PlayStation or Xbox, you’ll need to stream the gameplay on Twitch or YouTube. The easiest solution for Zoom is buying the game on Steam and playing it from your computer.\n\nAD\n\nCodenames\n\nA guessing game that requires some creative thinking (to play and setup).\n\nWhat you need to play: Zoom, one copy of Codenames and an extra camera to stream the board with some creative rigging equipment.\n\nAD\n\nIn Codenames, two teams — red and blue — race to correctly guess all their assigned cards in a grid of 25.\n\nEvery card has a word/codename, like “ghost,” and each team elects a spymaster who will provide one-word hints for their teammates to guess which words/code names belong to their team. For example, a spymaster might say “specter” to hint to their team that “ghost” is in fact an allied agent. If your team correctly guesses a card, you get to continue playing. The round stops when your team finds all your agents, stumbles upon a card belonging to the other team or finds a neutral card, dubbed a “bystander.” Spymasters can associate a number with their clue word to try to get their teammates to select more cards in one turn, increasing the difficulty but allowing for a bigger reward.\n\nThe entire game is a tabletop version of a minefield. Spymasters provide hints that are usually synonyms to the code names in play but it can be easy to question whether one hint is referring to two or three different cards. Maybe the hint is “city” but Paris, Berlin and Moscow are all on the table. On top of all this, one card is designated as the assassin and, if you select it, your team automatically loses.\n\nAD\n\nFor a game of Codenames on Zoom, you’re going to need an extra camera to display the board of cards to the entire group, like this. Whether you have a fancy rig with a webcam or a broomstick and phone with duct tape is entirely your call — so long as the entire group can read the names on all the cards. There’s also an unofficial workaround that alleviates the need for the second camera that you can find online, if you’d prefer to go that route.\n\nAfter that, you’ll need to figure out how to send the spymasters their keys at the start of every game. The quickest way may just be to message a picture to both players. Once you’ve solved those technical riddles, playing the game becomes pretty simple. You can even use the annotation tools in Zoom to tally up the “red” or “blue” agents as the game progresses."}
