In Dorohedoro, Kaiman (Caiman) and Nikaido hunt down the Sorcerers in the Hole, and now is your chance to binge this Netflix anime. And if you're a fan of manga, you'll likely be interested in Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun, based on the four-panel manga entitled Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun written and illustrated by Izumi Tsubaki. Scissor Seven season 2, known as Killer Seven in China, will rear its scissor-wielding head during the month of May, right off the heels of the smash hit of Scissor Seven season one.

The hit manga by Keisuke Itagaki, Grappler Baki (Baki the Grappler in North America) returns to Netflix anime streaming! Baki season 2 is likely one of the most anticipated anime shows returning to Netflix anime in the month of June. Baki Hanma and Mohammad Alai Jr will likely bud heads as they will inevitably compete for the love of Kozue Matsumoto in Baki season 2. Baki is just the tip of the iceberg in June, as Netflix will also serve up One Piece (East Blue and Alabasta story arcs) and Pokemon Journeys in June. Fans of the One Piece manga and anime are probably long overdue for a revisit to these two story arcs. 

Set sail for One Piece with Monkey D. Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates as Netflix will be streaming both the East Blue arc and the Alabasta arc, seasons one and two of One Piece. If you were wondering when there would be a Pokémon Sword and Shield anime, Netflix anime has the answer for you come June. Pokemon Journeys: the Series will likely satisfy fans of the Pokemon the Series: Sun and Moon anime who were waiting to see where Ash Ketchum and Pikachu were headed next. Looks like we'll be finding out in Pokemon Journeys!"
